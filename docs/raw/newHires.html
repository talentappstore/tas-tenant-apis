<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This recipe describes building a <b>new hires app</b> (e.g. <b>onboarding</b> or <b>payroll</b>) in Talent App Store.
</p>

<p>New hires is a label for a class of app that learns about job applications that have transitioned into a new "phase" such as Hired, using either the
batch oriented pull APIs, or the more real time push APIs.
</p>

<p>Both models rely heavily on application views. You'll need a good understanding of views to build your app.  
You can learn about views <a href='patterns.html#Application_views'>here</a>.
</p>


<p>In this example, your app uses the push model:

<ol>
<li>Your app produces the push API <a href='../generated/recruitment.raml.html#applications_views_at_onboard_now_byID__application__pushes_post'>POST /applications/views/at/onboard/now/byID/{application}/pushes</a>.    
<li>Fred applies for a job, resulting in a job application
<li>The recruitment team moves the application into the "shortlist" phase and evaluates Fred's suitability
<li>Eventually the team decides to hire Fred, and moves the application into the "onboard" phase.
<li>Immediately, the applicant tracking system (ATS) notifies your app by consuming
<a href='../generated/recruitment.raml.html#applications_views_at_onboard_now_byID__application__pushes_post'>POST /applications/views/at/onboard/now/byID/{application}/pushes</a>
on it.
<li>The request body includes a view - a formatted json object containing all the data your app needs about the job application, the candidate, the job, and other
resources such as the job's manager and recruiter. 
</ol>
</p>

<p>In this example, your app uses the pull model:

<ol>
<li>Your app consumes the pull API <a href='http://localhost:8080/tasgit/tas-tenant-apis/docs/generated/recruitment.raml.html#applications_views_at_onboard_now_get'>GET /applications/views/at/onboard/now</a>.
<li>Fred applies for a job, resulting in a job application
<li>The recruitment team moves the application into the "shortlist" phase and evaluates Fred's suitability
<li>Eventually the team decides to hire Fred, and moves the application into the "onboard" phase.
<li>On the hour, your app starts its scheduled pull of the latest candidates to be onboarded.
<li>Your app consumes GET  /applications/views/at/onboard/now, filtering to only get new onboarders since the previous upload
<li>The response includes a view for every new onboarder
<li>Once complete, your app stores the date of this upload, so it can be used as a filter when the upload next runs. 
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Available phases</h2>



<h1>Set up</h1>

<p>Lets look at the push APIs in action by installing some apps.
</p>

<p>Note: when installing apps, the apps that have links are sandbox apps that you install via their install token - the other apps
can be found publicly listed (find them with "Browse apps").
</p>

<h2>Install apps and prepare test data</h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li>First, follow <a href='sandboxapps.html#Setup_to_create_a_job_application'>these instructions</a> to install Agile ATS and create a job application.
<li>Return to Agile ATS and you should see the incoming job application (in the Incoming bucket).
<li>Install the <b><a href="sandboxapps.html">Agile alerts</a></b> app. This is a test app that listens to the push APIs, and emails the view to you.
</ol>
</p>

<p>In the following steps, we'll complete the setup to get a view, containing a new custom data field, pushed to the Agile alerts when a a new hire is made.
</p>
 
<h2>Capture data into a custom field when a new hire is made</h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Click to Settings -> Custom Fields -> Candidate -> User Provided.
<li>Create a date field with the title "Date hired", and key "DATEHIRED".
<li>On the same page, click the Workflow mappings tab.
<li>Check the box to map your new field to the Hired bucket - i.e. you are saying that when a new hire is made the field should be provided.  
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Add your custom field to the default view</h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Click to Setting -> Views and edit the default view.
<li>Under candidate, you'll see your Date hired field - check to add it to the default view.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Map the default view to the new hires event, for the test app</h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Click to Settings -> Pushes. We want the default view to be pushed to the Agile alerts app whenever a new hire is made, so create a new push with these details:
<ul>
<li>A name (anything)
<li>The app (Agile alerts in this case)
<li>The view to be used (default)
<li>The phase (Hire)
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Make the new hire</h2>

<p>Now that setup is complete:

<ol>
<li>go back to Agile ATS, and click to move your job application to the Hired bucket.
<li>You'll see your new field - enter a date in it and complete the move.
</ol>
</p>

<p>You're done! Now check your email (including your spam folder) and you should see an email from the Agile alerts app, with the contents of the default view, including your custom field.
</p> 


<h1>API flow to/from your app</h1>

<div class='seqDiag' id="seq0">

note right of app: a tenant installs your app
core->app: POST /tenants
note right of app: tenant opens your app
storefront->app: GET /appStatus
note right of app: ATS tells you about a new hire (or onboard, etc.)
ats->app: POST /applications/views/at/hire/now/byID/{application}/pushes

</div>


<h1>Implementing the APIs</h1>

<h2>Produce POST /tenants</h2>

<p>The first API call incoming to your app is to tell you that a tenant has installed it.
</p>

<p>Typically you might handle this API call by inserting into your customer table, sending an email to customer support team, etc. You
might show the "setup required" icon and a settings page to facilitate this.
</p>
  
<p>See <a href='./install.html'>installing and controlling setup and launch pages</a> for more.
</p>

<h2>Produce POST /applications/views/at/hire/now/byID/{application}/pushes</h2>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>
<a href='../generated/recruitment.raml.html#applications_views_at_hire_now_byID__application__pushes_post'>POST /applications/views/at/hire/now/byID/{application}/pushes</a>

Request:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/applicationRead-simple.json'></div>
</code></pre>

<p>Each incoming POST to your app's endpoint contains a <a href='patterns.html#Application_views'>view</a>, with details about the new hire.
</p>

<p>The view is customised by the customer to include only the fields that you need for the integration.
</p>
