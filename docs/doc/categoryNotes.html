<pre>
Tree semantics - jobs, locations
--------------------------------
The TAS tenant APIs have the concept of categories - a hierarchical system for categorizing jobs and candidates, which allows: 

- searching for jobs that match candidates
	- actively (candidate searches via UI)
	- passively (candidate gets email when new jobs are posted that match their own profile)
- searching for candidates
	- that match jobs
	- by the tenant, when searching candidates
	- by the tenant to create a search agent for candidates, possibly immediately after searching

For some categories, jobs are restricted to only having a single leaf node (category value).

General principles
------------------
Each category is an ordered list of one or more trees.

Within the trees, any node that has no children is a leaf. A node with children is a folder. A leaf becomes a folder as soon as a leaf is added to it.
A folder becomes a leaf when the last leaf is removed from it - i.e. a folder can never be empty.

There can be any number of trees, each starting from a single root node. The smallest possible category is a single leaf (i.e. a single tree with a root node having no child nodes).

A selection is a combined set of explicit folder selections and leaf selections. If a selection contains an explicit folder selection, that implicitly
selects all of that folder's leaves and sub-folders.

Example tree
------------
The following tree is used in the examples below:

/a
  /b
    /d
    /e
  /c
    /f
/g
  /h
  /i


Normalizing selections
----------------------
A set of category values should be "normalized", which specifically means that:
- any folder or leaf must be selected (explicitly or implicitly) only once - i.e., it is invalid to select both a node and one its ancestor nodes.
- the minimum possible number of folder and leaf selections must be used - i.e., it is invalid to explicitly select all of the leaves
beneath a folder without any differing details - the folder itself should be selected instead.

The following are correctly normalized:

/a
/b,/f
/a,/h

The following are not:

/b,/c (since /a would be more minimal)
/a,/b (since /a implies /b)
/d,/e (since /b would be more minimal) 
/f (since /c would be more minimal) 

A selection that was valid can become invalid due to changes in the master data. For example:

/d becomes invalid if the master data changes to:

/a
  /b
    /d
  /c
    /f

(Since /b would be more minimal).


Unprofiled subjects and searching
---------------------------------
When searching, it is desirable, for any given category, to match subjects (i.e. candidates and jobs) that have no values for that category. 

This allows the tenant to add new factors over time (e.g. work type), without instantly filtering out all existing candidates and jobs from searches (at least until they have profiled
themselves against the new category), and it also allows candidates to have "no selection" for factors they don't care about (e.g. work type).

To achieve this, searching follows a brute force rule that if a subject has no values for a category, then at the point of being filtered, they are given temporary selections of
the root node of every tree in the category.

For example, if Fred has no values for the example category, then instead Fred is treated as if he has:
/a,/g

There are shortcomings with this, e.g. a candidate who is profiled as Job == Gardening Center and Location == East Brunswick Support Office could be said
to have no selection for location, since there are no gardening jobs at the support offices. But there are no simple solutions so this is the best we can do.


Merging a profile onto an existing multi-valued subject (candidate, recruiter saved search)
--------------------------------------------
	Where the candidate has no profile:
		The profile is applied, even though it effectively shrinks the candidate's search presence



Aggregating specificity across a number of root nodes
-----------------------------------------------------
The individual specificities are all calculated, then the maximum is used.
 

* and then across numerous factors * 


General searching/matching
--------------------------
Factors are AND-ed.

Selections within individual factors are OR-ed.


Searching with an entire factor omitted
---------------------------------------
Generally, search subjects that have an empty selection are treated as if they have just the root node selected,
which means that they will match any search.

In more complex organizations, trees cannot be treated this simply, since things like location behave as a distinct set of subtrees. For example, only
certain locations are relevant for the Position Type "Assistant
Gardening Team Supervisor". In this case, the empty selection refers just to part of the tree being empty. 

ISSUE - should an artificial "ALL LOCATIONS" node be injected into the distilled location tree in a search UI when searching for "Assistant Gardening Team Supervisor" candidates?
If so, how is selection of that artificial node represented:
- on the wire, in parms to the "search candidates" API?
- on the wire, in parms to the "profile candidate" API?

If the answer to the above is "as an empty location selection", then are we moving towards allowing multiple root nodes? Since there is no need/use in having a single root node just to act as a "select all" actor?

Specificity
-----------
Specificity, a measure of how specific a selection is, where a lower number means the selection is more specific, is simply the count
of explicitly or implicitly selected leaves.

For example, a candidate who has selected a single job has a specificity of 1, whereas a candidate who has selected the root node, thus explicitly
selecting all 213 leaf nodes, has a specificity of 213.

Specificity is useful in ranking search results - for example a candidate who has selected only "butchery roles" is
a more likely fit than, and should appear in search results before, someone who has "all megacorp roles".


Hiding nodes
------------
Sometimes, a hiding selection can be applied to a tree. One example is hiding old, disused business groups that need to remain
in the tree but should not be selected for new positions.

A hiding selection must be normalized as per the same rules as a selection - e.g., hiding both a node and one of its ancestors is invalid.

Applying a hiding selection to a tree gives the result set. By "applying", we mean:
- for each hidden node
   - remove all direct and indirect descendant nodes
   - remove the hidden node itself
   - moving up through the ancestors, remove any ancestor that no longer has any child nodes

The last step above ensures that all nodes in the result tree are of the same type (leaf or folder) as they were before hiding. Without this step,
hiding the only leaf in a folder would result in the folder transforming to a leaf.

ISSUE: WHAT ABOUT stripping out ancestor folders that have only one child after hiding?
