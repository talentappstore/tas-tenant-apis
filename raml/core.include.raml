          order:
            description: |
              <p>The order parameter specifies the fields that are used to sort the result set. The actual fields that can used
              for sorting varies by resource - for <<resourcePathName>>, it is <b><<sortableFields>></b>.</p>
              
              <p>Use commas to combine multiple sort fields. Use the minus sign (-) to make sorting descending rather than ascending (the default).</p>
              
              <p>Order is commonly combined with the filter and limit parameters to achieve paging.</p>
              
              <p>Ordering is undefined if you don't specify the order parameter.</p>
            example: |
              return the first 20 widgets, ordered by id (ascending), with
              id > 128
              GET /widgets?order=id&filter=id%3E128&limit=20
              
              return the first set of widgets, ordered by quantity on hand
              (ascending), then name (descending), that are active
              GET /widgets?order=quantityOnHand,-name&filter=active%3D%3Dtrue
            type: string
            
          filter:
            description: |
              <p>The filter parameter applies an EMCAScript-like expression as per http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11
              to filter the result set. The actual fields that can used
              for filtering, and the complexity of the expression that is supported varies by resource - for <<resourcePathName>>, it is:</p>
              <p><b><<filterCapabilities>></b></p>.
              <p>The filter expression must be URL encoded before being used in a URI.</p>
            example: |
              return the first set of widgets, ordered by id (ascending), that
              pass the filter:   active==true||(id>20&&status=='online') 
              GET /widgets?order=id&filter=active%3D%3Dtrue%7C%7C(id%3E20%26%26status%3D%3D%27online%27)
            type: string
            
          limit:
            description: |
              <p>Limit specifies the maximum number of items that will be returned in this result set.
              Less items may be returned (for example, on the last page).</p>
              <p>For <<resourcePathName>>, limit must be less than or equal to <b><<maxLimit>></b>. This is also the default.</p>
            type: integer
            
          fields:
            description: |
              <p>Use the optional fields operator to specify a comma separated list of
              the exact set of fields you want the endpoint to return. Use the forward slash character to specify
              nested fields. For example:</p>

              <pre>
              GET /widgets?fields=kind,items/id,items/name

              Response:

              }
              </pre>
              
              <p>If you don't specify fields for <<resourcePathName>>, the default set of fields is:<br />
