<h1>Design notes on candidate edit spec</h1>

<pre>


          This API is used to prepare for an edit, by fetching, typically from an ATS:
          - the **amended profile** (none if the changes were denied)
          - the **amended set of jobs** (none if the changes were denied)
          - the **input model** derived from the amended profile 
          - an info, warning or error **message** to be shown to the candidate

          When called with a non-anonymous OAuth token, the candidate's identity is known, so the edit spec may have been tailored to the actual candidate.
       
          The **amended profile** is a (possibly) modified version of the profile passed in via URL params, with the changes needed to meet rules set by
          the tenant. For example:
          - candidate applying for pilot reqs must also register their interest in pilot jobs
          - candidates applying to some specific customer service req must first apply to the pipeline req
          - candidates apply to any req must agree to receive email
      
          Additional example since this API is on behalf:
          - candidates cannot apply to call centre reqs unless they have already been starred as 3 or greater in the call centre talent pool
            
          The **input model** defines the candidate facet data (e.g. resume, personal details, attached documents)
          that the candidate may or must provide in order to take on the amended profile, possibly also considering the device. For example:
          - if the amended profile includes applying for a job based in Australia, candidate may be asked "what is your eligibility to work in Australia?"
          - if the amended profile includes registering interest in financial advisor jobs in NZ, candidate might need to upload an industry certification.
          - if the device is smartphone, then a reduced set of questions may be asked
      
          Additional example since this API is on behalf:
          - if the profile includes applying for a job, and the candidate is internal, they may be asked "have you checked with your manager?"
          - if the profile includes applying for a job, and the candidate has already been pre-vetted (perhaps in-store) then they may get a vastly truncated application form
      
          The **message** contains a text message (possibly including links), and a message type, intended for showing to the candidate.
          The message may be used, for example, to explain to the candidate why their desired profile was amended, or denied. For example:
          - "you cannot apply for this req from a mobile phone - please use a desktop" 
          - "As a resident of Russia, you cannot apply for our jobs due to your country's data sovereignty laws"
      
          Additional example since this API is on behalf:
          - "sorry, you have already applied for this req - you can only apply once"

          OR
     
          This API returns the same input details as /candidates/E/N/profileEditSpecs, except that the response is not customized to a logged in
          candidate. Instead, the API accepts some additional parameters (candidate type, country of residence) that would normally be obtained
          directly from the candidate's TAS session or from their details in a database.
 
          This API is used, for example, to render a job application form to someone before they have authenticated, so they can understand
          what their experience will be like. Once they have authenticated, more accurate input details should be fetched using
          GET /candidates/E/N/profileEditSpecs.
