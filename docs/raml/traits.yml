- tasItem:
    queryParameters:
     $select:
       description: |
         <p>The $select query option is used to specify which properties should be returned in the resource. It behaves as per its namesake in
         OData (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part2-url-conventions.html).
         For example:</p>

         <pre>
         GET /widgets?$select=kind,items/id,items/name

         Response:

         {
           "kind": "widgets",
           "items": [
             {
               "id": 10223,
               "name": "Red widget"
             },

             }
           ]
         }
         </pre>
         
         <p>If you don't specify $select for <b><<resourcePathName>></b>, the default set of fields is:<br />
         <b><<defaultSelectList>></b>
       required: false
       type: string

- tasCollection:
    queryParameters:
     $orderby:
       description: |
         <p>The $orderby query option is used to order the entries, where the resource is a collection. It behaves as per its namesake in
         OData (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part2-url-conventions.html).
         The actual properties that can used varies by resource - for <b><<resourcePathName>></b>, it is <b><<orderingProperties>></b>.</p>
       example: |
         return widgets ordered by id (ascending)

         GET /widgets?$orderby=id
         
         return the first set of widgets, ordered by quantity on hand
         (ascending), then name (descending)
         GET /widgets?$orderby=quantityOnHand,name desc
       type: string
       
     $filter:
       description: |
         <p>The $filter query option is used to identity a subset of the entries, where the resource is a collection. It behaves as per its namesake in
         OData (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part2-url-conventions.html).
         <p>The actual properties that can used for filtering, and the complexity of the expression that is supported varies by resource -
         for <b><<resourcePathName>></b>, it is:</p>
         <p><b><<filterCapabilities>></b></p>.
         
       example: |
         return the widgets that are active, and that have status of 'online' or that are in Auckland:

         GET /widgets?$filter=active eq true and (status eq 'online' or location/city eq 'Auckland')
       type: string
       
     $top:
       description: |
         <p>The $top query option is used to limit the number of entries, where the resource is a collection. It behaves as per its namesake in
         OData (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part2-url-conventions.html).
         <p>For <b><<resourcePathName>></b>, $top must be less than or equal to <b><<maxTop>></b>. This is also the default.</p>
       example: |
         return the first 5 widgets:

         GET /widgets?$top=5
       type: integer
