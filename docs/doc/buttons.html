<h1>Buttons - overview</h1>

<p>Apps can cause their own candidate-facing buttons to be displayed in various places within other apps. For example, you might
display a "share" button on the job details page on the carer site. In this case your button might be displayed next to
other buttons like "apply", "refer a friend", etc.   
</p>

<p>Displaying buttons involves a handful of APIs between your app and others (for example switchgear, which
is an app provided by Aotal that gives tenants control over the order of buttons, and ways to control which buttons appear on which jobs).

<p>The key APIs you'll produce and consume are:

<ul>

<li><b>GET /actions/byCandidate/me/general/byName/{action}/byApp</b>
Your app should <b>produce</b> this API to return an array with an element for every different button that your app might ever provide (i.e., the superset of all of
your app's possible buttons).

<li><b>POST /actions/byCandidate/job/possibles/byApp/deltaPings</b>
Your app should <b>consume</b> this API if it ever changes its set of possible buttons (e.g. maybe you added one in response to a customer's request).

<li><b>GET /actions/byCandidate/me/jobs/{job}/byName/{action}/byApp</b>
Your app should <b>produce</b> this API to return details for the given button, **given the logged in candidate and this specific job**. Your app might
e.g. change the color, label, disabled, etc. of the button, or even hide it entirely (by returning 404).

<li><b>GET /actions/byCandidate/anonymous/jobs/{job}/byName/{action}/byApp</b>
As above, but for a logged in candidate.

</ul>

<p>There are similar APIs for the other places where candidate-facing buttons can be displayed (global, and search results).
</p>


<h1>Set up</h1>

<p>Lets prepare by installing some sandbox apps.
</p>

<p>Note: when installing apps, the apps that have links are sandbox apps that you install via their install token - the other apps
can be found publicly listed (find them with "Browse apps").
</p>

<h2>Install apps and prepare test data</h2>

<p>Follow <a href='sandboxapps.html#Setup_to_create_a_job_application'>these instructions</a> to install Developer ATS. The apply button
will be showing and you can click on it to create a job application.


<h2>Use switchgear to control buttons</h2>

<p>One of the apps you installed previously was Switchgear. Switchgear is an app that manages all of the buttons (apply, share, refer a friend, etc.)
from all of the button-producing apps.
</p>

<p>Typically a customer wants to show different combinations of those buttons to different candidates (e.g. internal vs external) on different
jobs (e.g. IT jobs vs call centre jobs). This complexity is all
handled via switchgear. Switchgear gives the customer a drag and drop user interface that they can use to drag button(s):
<ol>
<li>in or out at a global level, so that by default your button will appear or not appear on all jobs
<li>in or out at a job workflow level, so your button will apepar only on jobs that have a specific workflow (e.g. "retail")
<li>in or out of a specific job
</ol>
</p>

<h1>Create your app - produce the /possibles API</h1>

<p>Now that we've got the sandbox apps installed, we're ready to get your app up and running.
<ul>
<li>Go to https://developer.talentappstore.com. Create a developer account if you don't already have one.
<li>Define your app, giving it a name and shortcode.
</p>

<h2>Produce GET /actions/byCandidate/job/possibles/byApp</h2>

<p>Have your app produce the following API, to tell other apps (specifically switchgear) about its candidate facing buttons, e.g.:

<pre>
<code>
GET /actions/byCandidate/job/possibles/byApp (produce as non-SoT)

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/actionProductions-simple.json'></div>
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>The data that you are passing back in this example is as follows:

<ul>
<li><b>actionName</b> is the key for your button. Users recognise your button by this as they perform setup, e.g. controlling which
jobs your button appears on. It should be unique among all buttons your app produces (if more than one). If you have only one button,
consider using your company or app name.

<li>The <b>availableToInternals</b> and <b>availableToExternals</b> fields control whether the user is able to present your button to public job seekers
and/or employees.

<li>In this example, <b>mayRequireSetupFlag</b> is false, meaning your app does not have a setup page. This means, for example, that when
the tenant says that all of their "sales" jobs should have your button, they don't get to also configure your button at that point (e.g. for a quiz,
perhaps add some sales-specific questions).

</ul>
</p>


<h2>Install your app</h2>

<p>Install your app into your tenant.
</p>

<h2>Test that your API is being produced OK</h2>

<ol>
<li>Reboot the tenant, checking, e.g. via logging in your app, that your "possibles" API is being called.
<li>Open switchgear and your button should be visible under job actions.
</ol>


<h1>Create your app - produce remaining APIs</h1>

<p>Now that your possibles API is working, have your app produce two more APIs, one for logged in candidates and one for anonymous ones.
</p>

<h2>Produce GET /actions/byCandidate/../jobs/{job}/byName/{action}/byApp</h2>

<p>In your response, you pass back button details, like text, color, link, etc.

<pre>
<code>
GET /actions/byCandidate/me/jobs/{job}/byName/{action}/byApp
GET /actions/byCandidate/anonymous/jobs/{job}/byName/{action}/byApp

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/action-applyGate.json'></div>
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>The first form (/me/) is an <b>on-behalf</b> API.
</p>

<p>Switchgear will call this API when it is displaying your button to a logged in person (i.e. the candidate).
</p>

<p>As the producer of an on-behalf API, your app gets access to details about the logged-in person, such as their email address, name,
and a unique identifier for them.
</p>

<p>You might use that information to customize the details of your button. For example, if your button is an apply button, and the
candidate already has a job application for this job, you might decide not to show your button at all, or to show it in a
disabled state.
</p>

<p>The second form (/anonymous/) is a normal API.
</p>

<p>As the producer of this API, you don't know anything about the candidate who is looking at the job details page for this job, so you should
assume they are a public job seeker. 
</p>

<p>Its up to you to decide whether to treat these two APIs differently in your app, or just return the same response for both.
</p>

<p>In the response above:

<ul>
<li><b>name</b> corresponds to the actionName (that you passed back previously from your /possibles API).
<li><b>uri</b> is the link the user will be led to when they click your button. Since <b>behaviour</b> is "redirect", they will be redirected
rather than seeing your web page in an iframe inside a modal. In this case we just pass the relayPage through - you should additionally generate a signature for it
or otherwise prevent anyone from altering the relayPage, to prevent <a href='https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet'>open relay attacks</a>. 
<li><b>textColor</b> and <b>backgroundColor</b> allow you to customise how the button appears, along with <b>label</b> and <b>disabled</b>. 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Check that your button is showing on the jobs page</h2>

<p>Click into the Developer Careers app. You should see a job, with your buttons displayed on it.
</p>

<p>Click on your button, and you should be redirected to your app's web experience (e.g. applying for a job, completing a quiz, sharing the job, etc.).
</p>

<p>Once completed, your web experience should redirect the candidate correctly back to the relayPage (i.e. the job details page).
</p>    

<h1>Advanced - changing the buttons your app produces</h1>

<p>The button coordinating app (e.g. switchgear) will call your /possibles API to learn about your app's buttons at the time your app is installed. That will work
fine, as long as your app doesn't change its set of buttons after its been installed.
</p>

<p>However if your app does add new buttons (or remove or change existing ones) after install, then it should alert other interested apps of that by consuming:

<pre>
<code>
POST /actions/byCandidate/job/possibles/byApp

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/actionProductions-applyGate.json'></div>
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>This acts as a hint to switchgear (or any other app that cares) that it should call your /possibles API again, since your buttons may have changed.
</p>

<h1>Advanced - adding a setup page</h1>

<p>As long as your button doesn't need any additional information, the drag and drop user interface provided by switchgear is all the customer needs.
</p>

<p>However if your button requires some per-job or default setup then a setup page can be declared. The tenant will be prompted to complete
setup when the add the button to a job or as a default for a group of jobs.
</p>

<p>A setup page is a small HTML page that your app can present to the user right at the point when they drag
and drop your button into the global or workflow areas or onto a specific job.
</p>

<p>For example, lets say your app is an employee referral app. Employees can click your button on a job and then use your
user interface to refer the job to their friends. They get a cash reward if they are hired.
</p>

<p>In this example your app might present two separate setup pages:
<ol>
<li>when your button is dragged to the global or workflow areas, you capture the minimum, maximum and default cash reward (number fields)
<li>when your button is dragged or clicked on for a specific job, you capture the actual cash reward for this job
</ul>  
</ol>
</p>
