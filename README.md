Talent App Store
=======
[Talent App Store](http://www.talentappstore.com) is an open platform for integrating multi-tenanted HR microservices (apps).

Building an app? See the [wiki](https://github.com/talentappstore/tas-core-apis/wiki) for developer documentation, and also the [developer portal](https://developer.talentappstore.com).

Any developer can add their own APIs to TAS. This repository contains Aotal's recruitment-related [APIs, schemas and documentation](http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/). These are most of the APIs that we use when building our own apps for Talent App Store. They are open and can be freely used by anyone. Although Aotal is the company behind Talent App Store, Aotal's API definitions have no special status. Any developer can use them, copy them or fork them if required (we'd rather you shared your challenges though, so that we can try to address them).
