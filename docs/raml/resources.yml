      description: |
        This API is called to ask an app whether it wants to be displayed in the universal menu for the given context (e.g. for a specific job)
        
        The producing app should decide whether it has anything meaningful to display for this specific context, and if so
        it should return a link, which will be inected into the universal menu. For example, if the context is job 100, then an ATS app likely
        would inject the URL of its job details page for that job.
        
        Apps should not inject themselves in a spammy way (i.e. when they have nothing relevant to this context). The user
        can always get to the app via the storefront, and will find the spammy behaviour annoying, so there is no need to do this.

        For actions relating to jobs, the setup page can be used to set defaults (at either the global or workflow level) or values
        (at the job level).

        When this page has done its thing, it should signal the containing window via a postMessage call, passing one of the verbs "ok" or "cancel".

      description: |
        Get a single, named action from a single app. Non-SoT.
        
        The producing app might customise the button/control(s), or choose not display it at all e.g.;
        - for an apply button, display that a partial (draft) registration is already underway
        - gray the register button out if candidate logged in and already registered

        *Security considerations*: If the producing app attaches the incoming relayPage paramater to the button's link,
        then it should protect itelf from Open Redirection attacks as described at 
        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Client_Side_URL_Redirect_(OTG-CLIENT-004).
        
        One approach would be by:
        - attaching an additional digital signature to the link based on the link's other values, including the relayPage
        - verifying when the candidate follows the link that the relayPage has not been tampered with
        
        Another approach would be not putting the relayPage in the link at all, but instead storing it and
        putting a key into the link.
        
        The commonly used approach of whitelisting is not useful as there is no common repository of all of the valid
        domains in use by all apps that a tenant may have installed and that may include this action.

      description: |
        Your app should produce this API to return an array with an element for every different button that your app might ever provide (i.e., the superset of all of
        your app's possible buttons).
        
        Typically this will be called by a coordinating app at significant times, such as after the tenant is rebooted, or after your app has
        signalled a change to its buttons by calling the deltaPings API. That coordinating app can then present all possible buttons to some administrator,
        who can then flip some config switches to dictate which buttons should be shown in different situations.
        
        For example, the customer might want to only show a "refer a friend" button for their sales jobs, not their call center jobs.

        This API is for all possible buttons - at runtime, a different API will be called on your app to ask for actual details (color, label, disabled, etc.)
        of each **actual** button. For example, your app might declare with this API that it produces a "share" button, but then at runtime it might decide
        not to show the "share" button if it sees that the logged in candidate has exceeded some quota for sharing.
