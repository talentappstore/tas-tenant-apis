<h1>What you pay TAS</h1>

                <p>TAS Developers will pay TAS <b>$100NZD</b> plus New Zealand Goods and Services Tax (if any), and excluding all non-New Zealand taxes or levies (which are your responsibility to pay) per month for your App to be made publicly available to TAS customers and TAS Powered Marketplaces.  Publicly available Apps receive support from TAS to design and build their App and receive assistance in getting their App distributed across TAS Marketplace channels to reach a greater addressable market.</p>
                <p>TAS Developers who wish to use the TAS platform to develop a private App will be charged time and materials based on current consulting rates to assist with the design and build of their App as required if they choose to engage these services</p>
                <p>In addition, Developers of Apps used by customers in any of the Marketplaces powered by Talent App Store or via the use of a private token will pay TAS <b>$100NZD</b> plus New Zealand Goods and Services Tax (if any), and excluding all non-New Zealand taxes or levies (which are your responsibility to pay) per month for every customer that has your App installed into a <b>Production Tenant</b>.</p>
                <p><b>TAS</b> will issue you with an invoice on a monthly basis with charges related to customer installs for the month prior.  The amount will be the total number of customers with your App installed multiplied by $100.  Invoices will be issued in NZD.</p>
                <p>The email account you used to create a TAS Developer account will be notified every time a customer installs your App in their tenant.</p>
                <p>TAS is NOT responsible for ensuring customer installs are active customers of the vendor/TAS Developer.</p>
                <p>TAS Developers (or vendors who have an App developed on their behalf) may negotiate commercial terms with Talent App Store that supersede these commercial terms.</p>
                <p>TAS will make every endeavour to ensure invoices are accurate, will work with TAS Developers to resolve all queries about billing issues and will act in good faith to continue services to mutual customers.  Failure to pay invoices issued by TAS by the due date specified on the invoice will result in 30 days notice being given to remove your App from Talent App Store and all Marketplaces.  If, after this 30 day notice period, the unpaid invoice remains unpaid, your App will be removed, and all users of your integration will lose access to your App.</p>
                <p>Queries about billing can be raised by emailing <a href="mailto:help@talentappstore.com">help@talentappstore.com</a> or in our <a href="https://aotalltd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1">help centre</a></p>
                <p>TAS may change its fees from time to time by posting the new fees on the TAS Website and is not required to give you any other notice.</p>
