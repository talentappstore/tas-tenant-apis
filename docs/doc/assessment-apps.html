<h1>Table of contents</h1>

<div id="toc"></div>


<h1>Overview</h1>


<p>This document is intended to help developers present their HR SaaS product as an <b>assessment app</b> in Talent App Store.
</p>

<p>An <b>assessment</b> is some interaction relating to a job application at some point during the recruitment process, for example:
<ul>
<li>undertaking a skills assessment
<li>carrying out reference checks
<li>cultural/fit analysis
<li>carrying out medical checks or drug tests
<li>capturing video interview 
<li>gamification interaction
<li>probity check
<li>HR-XML assessment 
</ul>
</p>

<p>To complete an assessment, any of these parties might get involved along the way:

<ul>
<li>the candidate themselves, e.g. an online questionnaire where your app captures data to calculate cultural fit
<li>a user, e.g. a recruiter specifying which specific pre-employment checks they want
<li>you, the developer, e.g. you are a fact checking firm that verifies that the details in a candidate's resume are accurate
<li>some back end code, e.g. computer program that scours social networks and web sites, scraping the online footprints of the candidate
</ul>


<h1>Billing and financials</h1>

<p>As the vendors of the assessmenthub app, Aotal charges you, the developer, for every
API call to POST /assessments/byID/{id}/appDetails, with a completed assessment. 
</p>

<p>Fees will be based on either an agreed % of your total subscription fees to customers, or an agreed % of your fees per completed assessment,
and will be designed to fit in with your existing fee model. The minimum fee per completed assessment will be $US1.00.
There are no charges for partial/incomplete assessments.
</p>

<p>As for any app in Talent App Store, your app also pays for core API calls,
as described at <a href='http://developer.talentappstore.com'>http://developer.talentappstore.com</a>. These costs are low.
</p>



<h1>See assessments in action</h1>

<p>Lets look at assessments in action by installing some apps (if you're creating a new tenant, you may need to click the first install link twice).
</p>

<p>Go to <a href='https://www.talentappstore.com'>www.talentappstore.com</a>, sign up and create a tenant (use google auth to
avoid a temporary issue with email-based logins).
</p>

<p>Open the Tiny ATS app. You're looking at the recruiter's view of a demo ATS page, displaying a list of job applications.
</p>

<p>Create a single application. Use dummy values for all the id fields. Behind the scenes, your own email address will be used.
</p>

<p>Now install <a href='https://www.talentappstore.com/account/installLink?token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiJ9.ZGV2cGlja2V0.dfhr2af5ms_gJcRSgUR-rtnBVNy14_BvYRSZHgIWQeNesY45NE1J9oNlrHEqffnSmEernYqlPu-PkJS7NUQHMbiqNguzWvs7ZnPpk0hCDD7WaBJxKTOOAIZ7Dp4l4NBUAU6mu6Jx2JxM7hFw9pSKgADVq6wbvpCWqj1vv5CTMRQacvt2mkawlmVW5wP7G0FhuqRYQCwqpRZo9uZsZjGB3UDDnoFTHMZaFfhGWfJxhODCxBEC8YQ2tEJkC0prji9XeD9gau8Wa13RVIDYGOiLTpIJK4-V3cI1Jk2Oo9IGtSB93OK7Jep6i6FVVSq5ky517H__LfY4MQhQ6iBg-HZS1w'>Picket</a>, our sample assessment app. The picket assessment measures a candidate's affinity for
customer service by asking them to choose from several images representing good service.
</p>

<p>Return to the ATS. Now, against the application, you should see the assessment strip - a row of boxes, one for each assessment type - with a single box in it,
for the picket assessment. 
</p>

<p>Click on the picket assessment to start it. Note the picket image now has a dashed border, indicating the assessment is underway.

<p>Now check that you've received an email with a link to start the assessment. Don't click on the link just yet.
</p>

<p>Now install an identity app, so that candidates can log in (in order to complete assessments). Make sure to select "candidate" as the principal type when you install.
</p>

</p>

<p>Now click on the email in your inbox, and complete the picket assessment. The picket assessment is one that requires input form the candidate, but nothing from the user. 
</p>

<p>Back at the ATS, refresh the page, and the assessment should now appear as completed (solid border). click on the assessment to see the results.

</p>

<p>Click on the assessment to see the details results.
</p>

<p>Now started the police check assessment (icon of police hat). This assessment needs input from the user, so a red icon appears once the assessment is started. Click
on the icon and provide the input. Note how once the user completes the assessment-provided web page which is iframed within the popup, the popup closes automatically.

<p><b>Your assessment app</b>. Your app does the hard word of actually conducting the assessment. For example a basic
numeracy testing assessment might guide the candidate through a series of web pages, each one asking them an
arithmetic question, and then at the end calculate an overall score for them.
</p>

<p>The <b>assessment hub</b> app. The hub provides centralized assessment
management and is separate from any single assessment app. The assessment hub app:
<ul>
<li>stores the tenant's installed assessment apps - for example, the "Microsoft Office proficiency assessment app"
<li>stores a tenant-specific list of assessment types within each assessment
app - for example "MS Word proficiency - entry level", "MS Excel proficiency - guru"
<li>provides, via API, strips that the ATS can embed in applicant lists to start/view assessments
 <li>informs, via API, your assessment app when a new assessment is started
<li>skips assessment creation when an existing assessment for the candidate is available (reduces per-assessment
costs and candidate inconvenience)
<li>provides APIs for your assessment app to fetch and update the state of the assessment object
<li>stores summary current state of all assessments - status, pass/fail and the status image
<li>securely mediates assessment app access to specific fields of the candidate/application, and prevents assessment apps
from probing candidates they are not authorized to access
<li>provides a UI for the tenant to map assessment types to specific workflows (e.g., that the "sales skills 101"
assessment type is only available for call center jobs), and to mark assessment types as being auto-started for new job applications
</ul>
</p>

<p>The applicant tracking system (ATS) app. The ATS:

<ul>
<li>holds job applications and displays them as normal
<li>for each application, fetches assessment strip from assessment hub via API and displays
<li>Via the assessment strip, the user can start and view assessments directly within the ATS pages.
</ul>

<h1>Writing your app</h1>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href='http://developer.talentappstore.com'>The developer site</a>, for defining your app.

<li><a href='https://github.com/talentappstore/tas-core-apis/wiki'>The wiki</a>, where you can get general information on building TAS apps.

<li><a href='https://github.com/talentappstore/gauge'>A demo assessment app</a>, written in Java/Spring.

<li><a href='https://github.com/talentappstore/imageGen'>A demo dynamic image generator for assessment apps</a>, written in node.js.

<li><a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis'>TAS tenant API documentation</a>, for detailed technical information on the
TAS tenant APIs, including the assessment-related APIs.  

<li><a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-core-apis'>TAS core documentation</a>, for detailed technical information on the
TAS core APIs. You probably won't need to spend too much time interacting with the core APIs.  

</ul>


<h2>Handling installs</h2>

<p>(You can find a complete walkthrough of the actual steps to get your app handling installs <a href='https://github.com/talentappstore/tas-core-apis/wiki/4c.-Add-your-server,-and-produce-a-core-out-API'>here</a>.)
</p>
 
<p>Whenever a tenant clicks "install" on your app, your app is notified via an incoming core API call to
your <a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-core-apis/generated/coreOut.raml.html#tenants_post'>POST /tenants</a> endpoint.
</p>

<p>You should take this opportunity to do any per-customer setup, e.g. inserting into a customers
table, creating a record in your customer management system, sending a welcome email, etc.
</p>

<p>In the example below, TAS is informing your app that the tenant acme-sandbox-1 has just installed it.
</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
{
 "shortCode": "acme-sandbox-1",
 "name": "Acme sandbox testing site",
 "contactEmail": "fred@gmail.com",
 "type": "SANDBOX",
 "logoUrl": "https://s3-aws.com/786745987969"  
} 
</div>
</p>

<p>TAS supports a try before you buy model where customers you currently don't know can click to install your app and start using it. If your
app can provide on demand demo accounts, that will make it a much smoother path for all potential customers to try your product.
</p>


<h2>Pointing to your landing page</h2>

<p>(You can find a complete walkthrough of the actual steps to get your landing page working app handling installs <a href='https://github.com/talentappstore/tas-core-apis/wiki/4d.-Produce-a-tenant-API'>here</a>.)
</p>

<p>Whenever the tenant clicks "open" on your app, they go to your landing page.
</p>

<p>The storefront gets this by consuming <a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#appStatus_get'>GET /appStatus</a>
on your app.
</p>

<p>On your landing page you might display some kind of dashboard, app settings,
etc. You may choose to protect your landing page with SSO. If so, you can also check for the appropriate role (using admin is most restrictive).
</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/examples/landingPage-simple.json'></div>
</div>
</p>


<h2>Describing your app's assessment types</h2>

https://github.com/talentappstore/tas-core-apis/wiki/4d.-Produce-a-tenant-API

<p>The hub consumes 
<a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#assessmentTypes_forApp_get'>GET /assessmentTypes/forApp</a>
on your app to ask for your assessment types.
</p>

<p>Your app should declare at least one assessment type. If you are able to create a meaningful default experience it makes it easier for customers to try before they buy.
</p>

<p>In this example, your app is declaring that it supports a single assessment type, "MS Word proficiency".

<div class='codeBlock'>
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/examples/assessmentTypesForApp-simple.json'></div>
</div>

<p>Based on these settings, a candidate will only need to complete this assessment once, no matter how many different
jobs they apply for over the next year. Also, the candidate's results are not visible to the candidate themselves.
</p>

<p>Apps can use different strategies for their assessment types:
<ol>
<li>highly customised assessment types, e.g. each tenant has their own unique set of assessment types, tailored to
their needs (e.g., "Acme 2018 finance graduate assessment").
<li>a single, universal assessment type that is the same for all tenants installing the app (e.g. "MS Word proficiency").
<li>some combination of the above.
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Listening for incoming assessment requests</h2>

<p>At some point, an assessment for one of your assessment types will actually be started, e.g. when a recruiter selects it from a drop-down menu.
</p>

<p>That results in an assessment being created in the assessment hub
(which coordinates assessments across all assessment apps).
</p>

<p>The assessment hub then notifies your app by consuming your 
<a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#assessments_byID__id__tenantDeltaPings_post'>POST /assessments/byID/{id}/tenantDeltaPings</a>
endpoint. Your endpoint receives a message like this:

<div class='codeBlock'>
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/examples/deltaPing-simple.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Your app now has control over the lifecycle of the assessment (other than the customer putting it on hold or cancelling it).
You might do your own system's housekeeping for the new assessment, e.g. creating rows in your own tables, sending messages, etc.
</p>


<h3>Cleaning up PII, dealing with on hold</h3>

<p>Your app may also be informed via <a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#assessments_byID__id__tenantDeltaPings_post'>POST /assessments/byID/{id}/tenantDeltaPings</a>
 that an assessment has been deleted (e.g. in response to a privacy response, or to conform to data retention laws).
</p>

<p>In response, your app should clean up data held its own database relating to the assessment. 
</p>

<p>Your app may also be informed via this API that an assessment has been updated (e.g. in response to the tenant putting it on hold), in which case your
app should stop whatever it is doing with the candidate.
</p>


<h2>Getting base assessment details</h2>

<p>Once your app learns that the customer has started an assessment, typically, you'll fetch the details of the assessment by consuming
<a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#assessments_byID__id__get'>GET /assessments/byID/{id}</a>.
</p>


<h2>Getting the view</h2>

<p>Some assessment apps may need more details about the candidate, such as their CV, address, name, etc., or perhaps secure information such as salary.
</p>

<p>Your app can get these details from a view. The assessment details you fetched previously included a view key. Pass that in to your call to  
<a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#applications_views_byKey__key__get'>GET /applications/views/byKey/{key}</a>

<p>A view is a json formatted package containing all the data that the customer feels that your assessment app should see. If you need data added to the view,
you can contact the customer.
</p>  

<p>The view includes candidate name, address, answers to screening questions, linked data (e.g. resume/CV, cover letter, attached document(s)),
as well as data items pulled through from the job.
</p>
			
<p>The tenant can attach a different view to each assessment type, exposing just enough information for your assessment app to do its work.
</p>


<h2>Updating the assessment</h2>

<p>Having been alerted to a new assessment, and having fetched all details for the assessment, your product can do its thing for the assessment.
</p>

<p>At each stage of processing, your app should push the assessment's state up into the assessment hub by consuming 
<a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#assessments_byID__id__appDetails_patch'>PATCH /assessments/byID/{id}/appDetails</a>.

<p>The assessment's state includes:
<ul>
<li>Status
<li>Status image
<li>Interaction Urls
<li>Pass/fail flag (if applicable)
</ul>



<h3>The status image
</h3>

<p>A key part of building an assessment app is having a great status image.
</p> 

<p>One approach is to generate your images dynamically, e.,g. passing in the candidate's score as a URL parameter. For an
example of this, see this <a href='https://github.com/talentappstore/imageGen'>demo dynamic image generator for assessment apps</a>, written in node.js.
</p>

<p>The status image is important as it lets the user understand the results from your assessment at a glance, without needing to drill
in (unless they choose to). This is important in the information-dense screens in the ATS, which show many applicants and many assessments on a single page.
</p>

<p>Users will appreciate an image which is a great visual representation of your assessment:

<ul>
<li>A video interviewing app could render a video thumbnail.
<li>A psych assessment could render text with a percentage score, over a solid background in their corporate theme.
<li>A multi-stage probity test could render a series of checkboxes, with more boxes ticked as the assessment proceeds
<li>A culture fit test might show a colored graded heat gauge, with the needle pointing to the candidate's score
<li>A document check app could show a stamp, signifying complete       
</ul>

<p>The status image should be suitable for displaying at an effective resolution of 52x32. Ideally your image should be 2x this to cater for high
density displays (Retina Macbooks etc).
</p>

<p>
<img src='images/assessment-tile.png' />
</p>


<p>Status image is an alternate approach to the configuration-heavy traditional data integration used for assessments, 
where assessment results are sent to the ATS for storage. While data integration is possible with TAS, its often not required. By producing a good status
image, users can still meaningfully interact with your
assessment from within the ATS pages without any data integration.
</p>

<h3>Interaction Urls</h3>

<p>An assessment is a football that can be kicked back and forth between a number of parties before it is completed, all under the control of your app:
<ol>
<li>the candidate themselves, e.g. an online questionnaire where the
candidate provides some data that can be used to calculate
their cultural fit with the company they are apply for.
<li>you, the developer - e.g. you are a fact checking firm that verifies that the details in a candidate's resume are accurate.
<li>a user inside the tenant, e.g. a recruiter providing some details of specific tests they want to order
<li>no-one, e.g. a fully automated computer program that scours social networks and web sites, scraping the online footprints of the candidate.
</ol> 
</p>

<p>Your app controls this kicking around via setting the interactionUrls.
</p>

<p>There are two interaction URLs - candidate and user. If your app sets candidateInteractionUrl to have a value, and userInteractionUrl not,
then your app is saying that this assessment is waiting on input from just the candidate - the football has been kicked to the candidate.
</p>

<p>The assessment hub alerts each of the parties when the football has been kicked to them:
<ul>
<li>if candidateInteractionUrl is set, an email is sent to the candidate with the link in it (optional if your app already does this).
<li>if userInteractionUrl is set, your app's web page is rendered within a popup over the assessment strip, within the ATS pages. Your app
could request information from the user or present the assessment's results, e.g. attached documents.
</ul>

<h2>Leading the candidate to your site</h2>

<p>For this example, let's assume that your app does its thing by having the candidate complete an online
assessment. Below, it updates the assessment's status to indicate its underway, and sets the candidate interaction link. 

<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /assessments/byID/{}/appDetails
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/examples/assessmentWriteByApp-underway.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>At some stage the candidate will
follow this link and arrive at your online assessment.
</p>

<p>You can optionally protect your web pages with TAS SSO, using principal type of candidate. This protects against the
link falling into the hands of someone other than the candidate, and means the candidate enjoys a seamless
experience as they navigate into your app. 
</p>

<p>If you do use SSO, you should probably perform a sanity check that the candidate who logs in matches the one the assessment is for.  
</p> 
</b>


<h2>Marking the assessment as complete</h2>
   
<p>Once the candidate has completed the online process hosted at your app, your app
pushes the results, with the updated status.
</p>
<p>In this example, the assessment is now complete. It could also have been that the app
was just posting interim results.

<div class='codeBlock'>
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/examples/assessmentWriteByApp-completed.json'></div>
</div>
</p>


<h2>Reorienting the candidate</h2>

http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#candidates_me_homePage_get

<p>Finally, after your app has done its thing and completed the assessment, it should redirect the candidate's browser to the candidate "home page",
served by some other app. Their home page might direct them to the next assessment they need to complete, or
otherwise keep them updated.

<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /candidates/me/homePage
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/examples/homePage-simple.json'></div>
</div>
</p>


<h1>Advanced</h1>

<h2>Updating the list of assessment types</h2>

<p>From time to time, your app may introduce new assessment types (perhaps the tenant asks you for
a new custom assessment type, and you have just delivered it).

<p>When this happens, you need to consume
<a href='http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/generated/recruitment.raml.html#assessmentTypes_forApp_deltaPings_post'>POST /assessmentTypes/forApp/deltaPings</a>
on every app that produces it (which will include at least the assessment hub app).
</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
// get a list of apps that produce the API (i.e. that want be notified about new assessment types)
GET http://myapp.tazzy.io/core/routes/acme/jobboard/tas/%2fassessmentTypes%2fdeltaPings/false

Response:
{
    "producingAppInstalls": [
        {
            "appDeveloper": "tas",
            "app": "assessmenthub",
            ...
        },
        {
            "appDeveloper": "anydev",
            "app": "nosyapp",
            ...
        }
    ]
}

// now notify each app
POST http://myapp.tazzy.io/apps/assessmenthub/devs/tas/assessmentTypes/deltaPings
</div>
</p>

<p>In the future the tazzy proxy will make this easier for you.

<h2>Recognising on hold</h2>

<p>At any time prior to an assessment being completed, the tenant can place it on hold. Upon this, your assessment app should
pause any work underway if it can, and wait until the tenant either removes the on hold marking or cancels the assessment altogether.
</p>

<p>Your app learns about assessments being placed on hold by producing /assessments/byID/{}/tenantDeltaPings (same as for
learning about new assessments).
</p> 


<h1>Beware unverified tenants</h1>

<p>There is no tenant vetting process in Talent App Store, and anyone can set up a tenant, and install
publicly listed apps (or any app they have a link for), without any type of approval. Your new
tenant could be a genuine potential customer, a wandering visitor, or a competitor looking at your product.
</p>

<p>Your app should plan for malicious tenants (e.g. spammers, malware distributors, dodgy hosting sites).
We recommend that you set up a limited demo or read-only account for every new tenant. This way you can let
potential customers try out your product, but without incurring any significant risks or costs.
</p>

<p><b>Security:</b> If your app has any capacity to send messages (e.g. outgoing emails or SMS messages),
it is important that you <b>do not enable this</b> for demo accounts (except to the tenant contact email),
or your app may become a target for spammers and other bad actors. Likewise, if your app allows tenants to host
content (web pages, images, videos etc.) then you should limit or disable this functionality for demo accounts
to avoid your app being used to host objectionable, illegal, bandwidth-intensive or copyrighted material.
