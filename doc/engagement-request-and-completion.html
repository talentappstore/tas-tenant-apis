<title>Engagement APIs</title>
</head>
<body>


<h1>Table of contents</h1>

<div id="toc"></div>


<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The engagement APIs allow a tenant to use a third party (an engagement vendor) to perform some
kind of engagement action on a candidate or a job application, where that interaction results in data
that helps predict the candidate's suitability for employment.
</p>

<p>The API design is informed by the work of the HR-XML consortium, but is also suitable for very lightweight
engagements.
</p>
 
<p>An engagement might be anywhere along the scale from attract to hire, and might or might not involve
the candidate themselves, for example:
<ul>
<li>undertaking a skills assessment
<li>carrying out reference checks
<li>cultural/fit analysis
<li>carrying out medical checks or drug tests
<li>gamification interaction
<li>probity check
<li>HR-XML style assessment 
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Apps</h1>

<p>The diagram below shows the tenants and apps involved.
</p>

<p>The engagement vendor requires their own tenant.
</p>

<h2>Engagement app(s)</h2>

<p>The engagement  vendor delivers their engagement functionality as an app (an engagement app) that the
tenant can install.
</p>

<h2>Engagement hub app</h2>

<p>As well as the engagement apps they want, the tenant must also install a single "engagement hub"
app.
</p>

<p>The engagement hub provides centralized engagement
management and is separate from any single engagement app.
</p>

<p>It is tightly coupled (via shared database) to the engagement vendor app.
</p>

<p>The engagement hub app:
<ul>
<li>stores details of all engagement, including status, summary and detailed results
(including scores), links and actual attachments (documents)
<li>stores the tenant's installed engagement
apps - for example, the "Microsoft Office proficiency assessment app"
<li>stores a tenant-specific list of deployed engagement types within each engagement
app - for example "MS Word proficiency - entry level", "MS Excel proficiency - guru"
<li>allows the tenant to overwrite the title on each engagement type (for example, to rename
"MS Excel proficiency - guru" to "Excel expert"
<li>allows the tenant to specify a view against each engagement type - e.g. to make available the candidate's
completed "FSA disclosure" document when a "Finance team probity check" is performed. 
<li>can optionally copy down the set of default engagement types whenever a new tenant
installs the engagement app (useful for engagement apps that have fixed, generally
applicable purpose/volume engagement types; and/or
<li>provides APIs so the engagement vendor can manage engagement types directly
for any given tenant (useful when the tenant has a customised set of engagement types)
<li>stores the completed engagements
<li>securely mediates engagement app access to views of information about the
candidate/application, and prevents engagement apps from probing candidates they
are not authorized to access
<li>detects and securely tracks changes in view data (e.g. in the ATS, an additional
document is uploaded against the candidate while the engagement is in progress)
<li>prevents engagements being ordered when an existing report is available within the expiry time 
</ul>

<h2>Engagement vendor app</h2>

<p>A developer who is an engagement vendor must maintain a tenant of their own, and must
install the engagement vendor app. Covered more in detail below.
</p>

<h2>Engagement vendor UI app</h2>

<p>An engagement vendor will also usually install the engagementvendorui app which provides UI to:
<ul>
<li>View engagement apps 
<li>View tenants that have installed each app
<li>Manually manage engagement types for each install
<li>Manually complete a engagement (for engagement vendors with no technology of their own - others
will complete engagements in their own platform and use APIs to post the results to the engagement hub)
</ul>
</p>

<p>In theory an engagement vendor can accomplish all of the above through APIs so the engagement
vendor app is optional.
</p>


<h1>API design notes</h1>

<h2>Engagement types</h2>

<p>To avoid an unweildly proliferation of engagement apps, the engagement APIs support the concept of
an engagement type.
</p>
 
<p>The first step in the customer requesting an engagement is to select one of the engagement types that the engagement app offers.
</p>

<p>Some engagement apps may provide highly customised
engagement types, tailored to each individual customer's needs (e.g., "Acme finance graduate assessment"),
others just a single, generally applicable screen (e.g. "MS Word proficiency").
</p>

<p>The engagement app may update/complete the engagement through APIs, or an app is provided that lets zero-code vendors
update the engagement via screens.
</p>


<h2>Differences from HR-XML</h2>

<p>The design of the engagement APIs is informed by HR-XML but does not follow it slavishly.
</p>
 
<p>The HR-XML ScreeningResultTypeCode is not currently supported, as some of its possible values 
('Result'|'SummaryResult'|'Error'|'Message'|'Status'|'ManagementReport'|'MultipleResults') clash
with ScreeningStatusCode values (e.g. Error), or are not suited to microservices (e.g. MultipleResults).
</p>

<p>The ScreeningResultCode is not currently supported, as some of its possible values
('Pass'|'Fail'|'Review'|'RecordFound'|'NoRecordFound'|'Clear'|'UnableToContact'|
'UnableToFulfill'|'UnableToVerify'|'Positive'|'Negative') are ambiguous (HR-XML notes that
*this set of codes usually would need to be interpretated based on the type of screening and pre-existing understanding
between service provider and customer on criteria governing the application of the codes*), e.g. Pass vs Positive.
</p>

<h1>Scenarios</h1>

<li>as soon as their job application is complete, the ats automatically orders a testly engagement
<li>candidate is shown a link to complete their part

</div>

<h3>In detail</h3>

<p>Candidate applies for a job and appears in the ATS (jobly).
</p>

<p>The recruiter clicks an ATS menu item to "start an engagement".
</p>

<h4>ATS user gets the list of possible engagement types</h4>

<p>The ATS (jobly) asks the engagement hub app for the list of available engagement types, as served up by the sum
of the installed engagement apps.

<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /deployedEngagementTypes

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/engagementTypes-simple.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>A more sophisticated ATS might:
<ul>
<li>filter this list, to only present certain engagement apps/ screen types for certain jobs, according to some
mappings held by the ATS, e.g. only call center candidates are asked to undertake this assessment.
</ul>

<h4>Order an engagement</h4>

<p>The ATS user chooses an engagement type and hits "go".
</p>

<p>The ATS determines the candidate (or job application) that the engagement is for - in this case candidate 20887342.
</p>
    
The ATS calls:

<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /engagements/{engagementType}
</div>
</p>


<h2>Admin person sets up candidate view</h2>

<p>Views are an ordered set of fields and attachments related to a candidate that will be pulled together
for some purpose, e.g. being sent across to a third party who will be reference checking the candidate.
</p>

<p>In this case, the view specifies what the person/machine performing the screen will see.</p>

<h2>Engagement vendor uses UI to respond to an order</h2>




<h1>ATS integration</h1>

<p>The ATS may decide to do any of the following:
<ul>
<li>automatic firing
<li>manual firing
<li>on response
   <ul>
   <li>waiting
   <li>moving to a new bucket
   </ul>
<li>showing results summary in a table cell   
<li>reusing existing results
<li>cancelling when declined
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Engagementvendorui screens</h1>

<p>Within their own tenant, the engagement vendor has installed the app "engagementvendorui".</p>

<p>They can use this to see how many engagements they are currently working on, and for which tenants.</p>
