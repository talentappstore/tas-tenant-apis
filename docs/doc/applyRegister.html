<h1>Scenario</h1>

<p>This scenario involves these apps:
<ol>
<li>jobly, a simple ATS that renders the opening details page with an "apply now" button embedded in it
<li>simpleapply, an app that provides the "apply now" user interface, and pushes the job application into the ATS
<li>tracker, an app that provides the TAS tracker functionality
</ol>
</p>

<p>In this scenario, a candidate:
<ol>
<li>visits the tenant's corporate careers site hosted by jobly to look at a specific opening
<li>clicks apply now
<li>is sent to the simpleapply app
<li>logs in using Google
<li>completes a job application   
</ol>
</p>

<p>Other scenarios that are also handled by simpleapply, but not covered in this doc:
<ol>
<li>Candidate "registers" interest (does not apply for any specific job), possibly for a given category (e.g. Marketing)
<li>Candidate views their "existing data" (e.g. their resume, profile) using simpleapply, but within some larger container that lets also navigate to:
<ul>
<li>their in progress job applications
<li>their draft job applications (held by simpleapply)
</ul>
<li>Candidate applies for a shopping cart of jobs in one operation
<li>candidate clicks on a job they have already have a draft for
<li>candidate clicks to apply for a job that has a gating job 
</ol>
</p> 


<h1>Jobly (ATS) renders the job details page</h1>

<h2>Create a tracker</h2>

<p>In this scenario, jobly, the ATS, has its own particular system for
candidate source tracking which involves passing both candidateSource and deviceType parameters.</p>

<p>In this example, the candidate has reached the job by clicking on the link below (within a Facebook post), and the ATS has detected
that the candidate is using a mobile device:</p>

<pre><code>
https://acme.jobboard.com/openings/7622?candidateSource=facebook
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>The TAS tenant APIs use a different convention for source tracking, called tracker.

<p>If jobly was tracker-aware, the URL would have looked more like this (and jobly would not have needed to
create the campaign tracker:</p>

<pre><code>
https://acme.jobboard.com/openings/7622?tracker=73947484
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>However the ATS is not tracker-aware, so it needs to create a campaign tracker that will embed candidateSource and deviceType.
<pre><code>
POST /trackers/root
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/tracker-createLegacySourceTracker.json'></div>

Response: 201
Location: 763019932
</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Embed the apply now button</h2>

<p>With the tracker set up, the ATS (jobly) is ready to render the job details page.
</p>

<p>As part of that, the ATS asks all interested apps whether they have a candidate-facing button
(e.g. an apply button, join talent pool button, social sharing tool, view counter, etc.)
that they would like to inject into the job details page.</p>

<p>Since the candidate is not logged in, jobly calls the not-on-behalf version of the API to do this:</p>
<pre><code>
/buttons/candidates/jobs/{job}/all/anonymous?tracker=763019932

Response:
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Since the candidate is not logged in, the apply button(s) can't say (for example), "You've already applied".
Instead, the panel shows whatever is appropriate for a completely unknown candidate, which is to allow apply.</p>
</p>

<p>If the candidate was logged in, jobly would use the on-behalf version in stead:
<pre><code>
/buttons/candidates/jobs/{job}/all/me?tracker=763019932

Response:
</code></pre>
</p>


<h1>Candidate clicks apply</h1>

<p>The entire job details page, and the apply button within it, are now rendered, so the candidate sees the "apply now" button at
the bottom of the job description.
</p>

<p>Note how the apps that generated the individual button links derived the loggedIn query parameter value from
whether the button was generated from an on-behalf API call (logged in candidate) or for an anonymous candidate.
</p>
     
<pre><code>
https://acme.simpleapply.com/jobs/7622?tracker=763019932&relayPage=acme.jobly.com/jobs/7622?loggedIn=false
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>The candidate clicks on the simpleapply link and is directed to the apply form.
</p>

<h1>Apply form</h1>

<p>Candidate is now at:
<pre><code>
https://acme.simpleapply.com/jobs/7622?tracker=763019932&relayPage=acme.jobly.com/jobs/7622?loggedIn=false
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>simpleapply renders its apply form slightly differently depending on whether a candidate is logged in or not.
An anonymous visitor can't complete the form but can only view it. An anonymous visitor also sees the login disco panel
embedded at the top of the page.</p>

<p>simpleapply has the loggedIn filter described in <a href='conventions.html'>conventions.html</a>, but the filter doesn't fire
since loggedIn = false.
</p>

<p>The page is white listed in the proxy's SSO settings.</p>

<p>simpleapply checks for the tazzy-saml header. Even though this page is white listed, its possible the candidate did log in previously
somewhere else on simpleapply. In this example, the header is not present.
</p>

<h2>Render for non-logged in candidate</h2>

<p>simpleapply's goal is to show as much as possible of the apply "form" to the
candidate, so that they can assess how much work it will be, and hopefully be
enticed by simpleapply's support for cloud storage (dropbox etc.) for resumes,
mobile-friendly UI, ease of login via social networks, etc.
</p>

<p>At the top of this "not logged in" page is an iframe displaying a panel of login controls courtesy of the TAS
identity system as per <a href='conventions.html'>conventions.html</a>.
</p>


<h2>simpleapply fetches edit spec for non-logged in candidate</h2>

<p>In this example the candidate is not yet logged in, simpleapply can't check for role==internal
on the TAS session - instead it can only show those questions that an external candidate would need to answer.
If the job is internal only, simpleapply would show no details at all, and would only offer the candidate a way
to log in (so they could prove they were internal).
</p>

<p>Deciding what to display to the candidate may involve complex logic, which
does not belong inside simpleapply, but is more likely in the ATS.</p>

<p>simpleapply asks for an <b>edit spec</b> for applying to this job by an anonymous candidate.  


<pre><code>
POST /editSpecs/fetches/apply/7622/anonymous


Request:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/intent-apply.json'></div>
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>The response includes all the information needed to render the apply form to an
anonymous candidate (we look in more detail later).</p>

<p>We want them to see how easy the process was, but so that no-one can actually apply until they are logged in,
simpleapply renders the form with all fields disabled.  
</p>


<h1>Candidate logs in to simpleapply</h1>

<p>The candidate sees the apply form, and decides that they are prepared to invest
their time in applying, so logs in using Google (within the iframe-ed panel).
</p>

<p>TAS redirects the user (still inside the iframe) back to:
<pre><code>
https://acme.simpleapply.com/secure/redirectFor/jobs/7622?tracker=763019932&relayPage=acme.jobly.com/jobs/7622
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>That resource is now served up, since SSO now allows the request through. It is not a web page but instead responds with a http 302 redirect.
The user is redirected to the logged in page, i.e.:
<pre><code>
https://acme.simpleapply.com/secure/jobs/7622?tracker=763019932&relayPage=acme.jobly.com/jobs/7622
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>The redirect happens to the outer page, not the iframe - so now the user's browser address bar has the above in it,
and the candidate is looking at the logged in page.
</p>

<p>Now the candidate has logged in, their roles are available (e.g. role == internal).</p> 

<p>Simpleapply re-renders its page, now knowing who the candidate is.
</p>

<h1>Simpleapply renders its page (candidate logged in)</h1>

<h2>Re-fetch the edit spec</h2>

<h3>Absorb the candidate's existing information into the intent</h3>

<p>Now that the candidate has logged in, simpleapply is ready to re-fetch the application form,
this time for real (e.g. maybe now jobly knows who the candidate is, it can detect they've been black-listed and prevent the apply altogether).</p>

<h3>Design decision - replace vs. merge of the candidate's categories</h3>

<p>The <b>POST /candidates/me</b> API, which simpleapply will
eventually use to push the edit into the jobly ATS, supports two modes for setting the candidate's categories.
<dl>

<dt>merge</dt><dd>The category values in the request are merged with any existing values on the
candidate. Suitable for one-click or offline scenarios, e.g. "enter your email here to hear about new finance jobs", where the
UI never had a chance to query the candidate's existing data, and does not want to overwrite it.</dd>

<dt>replace</dt><dd>The category values in the request completely replace any existing values on the candidate. Suitable for
online scenarios, like a conventional apply form, where the candidate logs in and the UI has a chance to present all of their
new and existing categories to them for tailoring.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Simpleapply uses <b>replace</b> semantics. Read the rest of this section for more details or skip on.</p> 

<p>TODO: make clearer.</p>

<p>At the moment, the intent contains no categories, just the job that the candidate wants
to apply to. When we get the edit spec back from jobly
we might find some categories in there that were implied by the job for example the
job "Co-pilot long-haul, Pacific" might imply expertise == pilot, which might in turn unlock some
data entry fields to do with being a pilot.</p>

<p>However simpleapply now wants to merge in any existing category values that <b>the candidate already
has</b> (assuming they have a row in the ATS).</p>

<p>For example the candidate might have previously profiled themselves as expertise == CEO.</p>

<p>Simpleapply's philosophy is to encourage candidates to keep their profiles accurate, so in this
case it wants to add CEO to the intent.</p>

<p>This may result in the apply form containing information relevant
to CEO, possibly confusing the candidate who thought they were applying to be a pilot,
and has forgot that they had partially profiled themselves as CEO. On the other hand, it may encourage them
to unprofile themselves as CEO, keeping the database cleaner.
</p>

<p>In summary, simpleapply uses the philosophy of presenting to the candidate their entire category selections,
allowing them to make changes, and then completely overwriting (with semantics == replace) the categories
on their candidate record.<p>

<p>Another philosophy would be for simpleapply to only present the categories related
to the job the candidate was applying to, ignoring any other stuff lurking on their
candidate record, and then use semantics == merge when applying the changes to the
candidate record (via POST /candidates). The advantage to this is that the candidate only has to
provide valid data for the job they are applying to, and does not have to clean up their record as a whole.</p>

<h3>Fetching the candidate's existing information into the intent</h3>
 
<p>Since simpleapply is going to use replace semantics for the candidate's categories, it now needs to
create a merged set of the candidate's existing category values and the category values indicated in the edit spec.

<pre><code>
POST /candidates/me/categories/merges

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/categoriesActual-simple.json'></div>
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>If the API returns 404, the candidate does not already exist. Simpleapply just uses the values from the edit spec in this case.

<p>Now:
<ol>
<li>The candidate has logged in
<li>We've created an intent which indicates
<ul>
<li>what categories they want to end up with, i.e. the sum of what they already had and any new ones
<li>the job they want to apply for
</li>
</ol>

<p>Simpleapply again fetches the edit spec, this time using the new intent, and the on-behalf API</p>

<pre><code>
POST /editSpecs/fetches/apply/7622/me

Request:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/intent-applyPlusExistingCats.json'></div>

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/candidateEditSpec-apply.json'></div>
</code></pre>
</p>


<h3>How the ATS builds the edit spec</h3>

<p>To build the edit spec, the ATS (jobly) will use data from:
<ul>
<li>the sub field of the OAuth token passed to the edit spec fetch. This provides access to the candidate's role(s), e.g. whether they are internal
<li>the ATS database - e.g. whether the candidate has been made redundant within the last 2 years, or failed a drug test during a previous recruitment process,
and hence cannot apply at all
</ul>

<p>Note that the amended intent may indicate that, even though the candidate wishes to apply for some given job, the ATS
may have other plans for them and may have amended their intent(in this case
the message should explain to the candidate what and why). For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>candidate applying for pilot jobs must also select a category value for pilot
<li>candidates applying to some specific customer service job must first apply to a customer service talent pool role
</ul>


</div> 
</p>

<h3>Fetch the required engagements</h3>

TODO.

<p>Great! Now simpleapply has the details it needs to begin building its UI.</p>



<h2>Set up UI</h2>

<p>Simpleapply creates the UI that it will display to the candidate.</p>

<p>To populate the UI, simpleapply will merge data in from:
<ul>
<li>the edit spec (it has default values for some fields, and also contains the category values)
<li>from any existing draft for the job being applied for
<li>from the existing candidate record if there is one (but not its category values)
</ul>

<p>Simpleapply uses a merge strategy that prevents an old draft from overwriting candidate details. E.g. candidate
starts to apply for A, saves as a draft with empty personal details, then moves on and applies to B with
completed personal details, then returns to apply for A. We don't want the empty personal details on the draft for A
to overwrite the filled in details on the candidate record.
</p>

<h3>Display the message</h3>

<p>At the top of the page, simpleapply displays the message (if any) in the style suggested. In a situation where the job is internal only,
and the candidate is not internal, there might be nothing displayed but the message. In other situations there might be no message at all.</p> 

<h3>Set up input fields and controls</h3>

<p>Simpleapply now uses the information from the candidateModel and applicationModel sections to set up the UI - i.e. when
applying for a job, these are more or less the application form.</p>

<h3>vcard</h3>

<p>Simpleapply gets existing vcard values:
<pre><code>
GET /candidates/me/vcard

Request:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/categoriesActual-simple.json'></div>
</code></pre>
</p>


<h3>Populate default values</h3>

<p>The inputModel also includes some default values, e.g. for individual fields in the items
section(s). These should be loaded into the input controls.</p> 

<h3>Populate category controls</h3>

<p>Since categories may be large (e.g. a definitive list of every county in the US) it's up to simpleapply to decide
how to fetch all possible values so the user can select. For small categories, simpleapply might fetch the entire
category. For larger ones, it might use ajax calls to only fetch values as, say, the user clicks to expand a node in the hierarchy.
</p>

<pre><code>
Get list of all categories ..
GET /categories

.. and its tree of nodes
GET /categories/10033/values
</code></pre>
</p>


<h2>Fetch previously entered data</h2>

<p>Once the UI has been laid out, simpleapply next needs to load the fields with any existing data (this only
applies when there is an existing candidate record). Specifically:

<ul>
<li>the amended intent provides the full set of category values
<li>in the case of existing candidates, the fine-grained candidate APIs (e.g. GET /candidates/{}/resume) provide access to the
data already held in the ATS
<li>Some data is also available on the TAS session from the idp and/or login listeners. For example if the candidate has
logged in using Facebook, then their name and image may be available on the TAS session.
</li>
</ul>


The classes of items as per above are:
personal details (vcard)
job alert (notifications) flag
categories
etc..


<h4>Load existing resume</h4>

<p>Simpleapply fetches details of the candidate's existing resume (not the stream itself which might be enormous)

TODO

<pre><code>
GET /candidates/me/resume/meta

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/fileDownload-simple.json'></div>
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Simpleapply also displays a link which the candidate can click through on to open their existing resume document. 

TODO

<pre><code>
GET /candidates/me/resume/asStream
</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>Load details of existing applications</h4>

<p>If the candidate already has a record in the database, Simpleapply now loads up any
previously entered candidate data for the job application(s).</p>    

<p>Normally candidates are applying from scratch, so there is no previous data, and then once
they have applied, they cannot go back and change any application data.</p>

<p>But its possible that the candidate has previously submitted this application. This could happen if:
<ul>
<li>they submitted it through some thin, offline client, and now we are
asking them to go back and re-submit with more information
<li>the application is to some kind of talent pool/continuous opening,
and they have sat out some stand-down period and are now able to re-apply.
</ul>
</p>

<pre><code>
GET /applications/byCandidate/{candidateID}/byOpening/{openingID}

Response:
902533

GET /applications/902533/items
</code></pre>
</p>

<h3>Using data from the TAS session</h3>

TODO: clarify that simpleapply can access name, image, email off of the SAML assertion using the new helper API.

Pre-populate fields in the UberApply form 



<h1>Candidate fills out apply form</h1>

<p>simpleapply now renders the page to the candidate, who can start editing, selecting and generally completing the form.</p> 

<h2>Candidate uploads a new resume</h2>

<p>The candidate wants to replace their existing resume, so uploads a new document which simpleapply stores somewhere, perhaps
in a temporary file.</p>   

<h2>Save draft</h2>

<p>simpleapply includes split-level draft functionality. This prevents candidate details being overwritten.
</p>

<pre>
A single draft is held for candidate details, keyed by E/N
A single draft per job being applied for, keyed by E/N/J
On successful submission
   Of apply
      Candidate and job level drafts are deleted
   Of register
      Candidate level draft is deleted
</pre>

<p>The ATS (jobly) is unaware of any draft functionality, simpleapply only pushes completed edits to it.</p> 


<h2>Candidate edits categories</h2>

<p>While the candidate is using simpleapply, they may change their categories.</p>

<p>If they do, then simpleapply must re-fetch the edit spec, since a change in categories may
result in knock on changes in the amended intent, and in the input model (e.g. a candidate who
adds expertise == pilot must now answer additional questions).</p>

<p>This may be quite involved for simpleapply, as it needs to temporarily
preserve any data from the fields (perhaps using its own draft functionality), rebuild the UI
using the new edit spec, then reapply that data.</p> 


<h2>More candidate interactions with the apply form</h2>

<pre>
TODO: flesh out 
candidate clicks to view an existing (exists back on their candidate record) document attachment/CV 

candidate clicks to view a newly added (only present in draft) document attachment/CV
 
candidate deletes an existing answer (a no longer required one? any one?)

candidate deletes an existing document attachment/CV

candidate deletes a newly added document attachment/CV

candidate completes their application (draft gets deleted)

candidate deletes a draft application

candidate deletes their entire profile (maybe another app?)
</pre>




<h1>Candidate submits application</h1>

<h2>Render the "Next steps" page</h2>

<p>We need to show the candidate the engagements they are going to have to complete. This means first actually instantiating them if they haven't been already.
</p>

<p>Eager creating - this creates the engagements even if the candidate just popped in to see how arduous it will be and browses away - in that case these 
will get cleaned up by the engagement hub's reaper. The reaper daemon reaps unfinalized engagements after 6 weeks (leaves time for
candidate to return to a draft application from earlier).

<pre><code>
Request:
POST /candidates/me/engagements/forJobs/instantiates
-- intent
[ "jobs": .. ]

Response:
[
  {
    "engagement": 10022,
    "linkages": [ 13005, 13006 ]
  }
]
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Render the engagement's name

<pre><code>
GET /candidates/me/engagements/{e}/candidate
{
   "engagementID":
   "entityID":
   "nameID":
   "firstName":
   "lastName":
   "email":
}
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Render each engagement into the page, passing the current page in as the relay page. Rather than iframeing, which would stop engagements
rendering outside their area (e.g. large pop-up menus), we inject Javascript. More security risk. Better usability.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
GET /candidates/me/engagements/{e}/candidateView?size=medium&relayPage=[this page]

Response:
application/javascript
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Once the page is served, candidate sees panels for each engagement, along with tick or cross if the engagement has both "isPassFail" and "candidateSeesFail" true. 
<pre><code>
GET /candidates/me/engagements/{e}/engagementType
{
   "isPassFail":
   "candidateSeesFail":
}   
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>ATS tells engagement hub to finalize the engagement linkages that need to be completed by this candidate given the job(s) they are applying for.
</p>

<p>The hub will bail if any one of the engagements is not complete.

<pre><code>
POST /candidates/me/engagements/forJobs/finalizes
POST /candidates/me/engagements/forTalentPool/{tp}/finalizes
</code></pre>
</p>


<h1>Finalize engagements</h1>

<p>
<pre>
TODO:

Attach the engamenents to their job applications or talent pool memberships.

The ATS handles this under POST /candidates.

Most of the work is delegated to the engagement hub.

After this all the engagements are finalized (hold application ID).

Job board tells .. present 
Job board tells .. prepare 


ATS tells engagement hub to finalize the engagement linkages that need to be completed by this candidate given the job(s) they are applying for.

POST /candidates/me/engagements/forJobs/finalizes
POST /candidates/me/engagements/forTalentPool/{tp}/finalizes
Request:
[ 12, 14 ]

Each of these can be mapped back to the underlying engagement.  
 
Response:

The result is an ordered list of engagement.
   
engagement hub creates a bunch of engagements as a result of this list.

The results are a set of engagement types.

An engagement type may be tailored to a specific job. In that case the 

Those types can make use of the intent to

<p>Once the candidate has finally completed their work and pressed submit, the completed edit (i.e., job application in
this example]) is sent to the ATS (jobly).
</p>

<pre><code>
POST /candidates

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/candidateEdit-simple.json'></div>
</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>ATS processes the event</h2>

TODO: clean up any existing messages. 

<p>The ATS processes the event. This may result in creating a new candidate or updating an existing one.
</p>

<h2>Processing the tracker</h2>

<p>The ATS fetches the chain of trackers, starting from the one passed across to POST /candidates.</p>

<pre><code>
GET /trackers/763019932/chain

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/trackers-legacyATS.json'></div>
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Now the ATS applies its custom logic to cope with its own source conventions.</p>

<p>In the case of jobly, it wants two pieces of metadata about the application:
<ol>
<li>candidateSource
<li>deviceClass
</ol>

<p>The ATS first looks to see if these were passed in, and if not it establishes them from the information in the trackers.</p>

<pre><code>
TODO: cleanup

// see if candidateSource was passed in
candidateSource = destinationTracker.meta.candidateSource;
if (candidateSource == null)
   // source was not passed in, so derive it from the visit tracker's fields
   candidateSource = extractCandidateSource(visitTracker.landingURI);
 
// likewise for device class
deviceClass = destinationTracker.meta.deviceClass;
if (deviceClass == null)
   // deviceClass was not passed in, so derive it from the user agent
   // this ATS might use a user agent database to resolve down to mobile == true or false for example
   deviceClass = extractDeviceClass(visitTracker.userAgent)
</code></pre>

 
<h1>Candidate is redirected back to job details page</h1>

<p>Based on the http result from the event post, simpleapply then displays the "Successful" page.</p>

<p>A button on that page links the user back to the relay page (i.e the
original job details page in this example of applying for a job).</p>

<p>User is now back at the job details page.</p>

TODO:

The recruiter views the underway/ completed/ finalized/ engagements for a candidate.
