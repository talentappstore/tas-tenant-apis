                    <h1>Overview</h1>

                    <p>This describes how to build a Job Board app that will integrate with the Job Board Hub in Talent
                        App Store.
                    </p>

                    <p>Job Board Hub is a central Job Advertisement creating app that allows customers to choose Job
                        Boards that they have installed in Talent App Store and post, update or expire advertisements
                        without having to navigate to all the different apps individually.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Set up</h1>

                    <p>To have data flowing to and from your app, there are a couple of prerequisite apps that need to
                        be installed first.
                    </p>

                    <p>Note: when installing apps, the apps that have links are sandbox apps that you install via their
                        install token - the other apps can be found publicly listed (find them with "Browse apps").
                    </p>

                    <h2>Install apps and prepare test data</h2>

                    <p>First, follow these instructions to install Developer ATS and create a job application. Then:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Install the publicly listed Job Board Hub app in Talent App Store.</li>
                        <li>Return to Developer ATS and you should see a panel showing on the right hand side of the
                            job.
                        </li>
                        <li>There are no Job Boards currently setup so you will not be able to post a new advertisement,
                            you can installed the "Demo Job Board" app.
                        </li>
                        <li>Click refresh on the job within Developer ATS. Now, in the panel within the Job, you should
                            now see the Demo Job Board app as a selectable option to submit a new advertisement to.
                        </li>
                        <li>Submit a new advertisement and the panel will now display some information about the
                            advertisement that was just submitted.
                        </li>
                    </ol>


                    <h1>API Flow to / from your app</h1>
                    <image style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%; min-width: 500px;" src="../images/jobboardhub.png">

                    <h1>Building the app / Implementing the APIs</h1>

                    <p>Before building a Job Board App, take a look over the App Install and Setup recipe and
                        familiarise yourself with that. Once you are confident in building a basic TAS app that can be
                        installed and show an necessary settings screens, it is time to move on.
                    </p>

                    <p>A Job Board App does not need to consume any TAS Tenant APIs only produce them. To see more
                        details about the APIs that need to be produced, see below in the "Produce APIs" section.
                    </p>

                    <p>Once you have the basic App setup on Talent App Store, you will need to start implementing the
                        APIs for the Job Board Hub to consume. The first thing the Job Board Hub does when your Job
                        Board App is installed is call the ```/jobBoards/forApp``` API and create a record for your Job
                        Board App where recruiters will be able to select your Job Board as one of the platforms to post
                        their new Advertisement.
                    </p>

                    <p>Note: The Job Board Hub will produce the application url. The final URL will include the legacy
                        source code and a tracker.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Produce POST /tenant</h2>

                    <p>The first API call incoming to your app is to tell you that a tenant has installed it.</p>

                    <p>Typically you might handle this API call by inserting into your customer table, sending an email
                        to customer support team, etc. You might show the "setup required" icon and a settings page to
                        facilitate this.
                    </p>

                    <p>See installing and controlling setup and launch pages for more.</p>

                    <h2>Produce GET /jobBoards/forApp</h2>

                        <a href="../generated/recruitment.raml.html#assessmentTypes_forApp_get" target="_blank">Click here to view schema</a>

                    <h3>Detail</h3>
                    <h4>Returning information about your Job Board</h4>

                    <p>See the Job Boards schema for a detailed description of the properties you need to populate when
                        producing this API.
                    </p>

                    <p>Immediately after your app is installed, the Job Board Hub, a separate app, consumes
                        <strong>GET /jobBoards/forApp</strong>
                        on your app to fetch information about your app and stores in the Job Board Hub database.
                    </p>

                    <p>When you refresh the page on the Developer ATS Jobs page, you will now see your app available to
                        be selected as a Job Board to post a new advertisement to. The following information is used
                        during this process within the Job Board Hub:
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
"label": "Super Job Board",
"logo": "https://talentappstore.com/logo.png",
"domain": "https://superjobboard.example",
"defaultAdvertisementDuration": 30,
"defaultLegacySourceCode": "SJB",
"defaultSetupErrorMessage": "Missing required information"
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <h4>If your app needs to be setup</h4>
                    <p>If you have some required settings before the recruiter can use your app, populate the
                        "defaultSetupErrorMessage" field with some useful message for the recruiter to understand.
                    </p>

                    <p>For example: "You need to finishing adding your credentials into the Super Job Board app in
                        Talent App Store".
                    </p>

                    <h4>New advertisement posting</h4>
                    <p>When a recruiter has selected your Job Board App in the Job Board Hub, the Job Board Hub will
                        consume the API
                        <strong>GET /jobBoards/forApp</strong>
                        from your app and fetch the information that your app requires when creating a new Advertisement
                        on your platform.
                    </p>

                    <p>When building your Item Metas note that the Job Board Hub only supports the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>StringMeta</li>
                        <li>NumberMeta</li>
                        <li>BooleanMeta</li>
                        <li>DateMeta</li>
                        <li>PicklistMeta</li>
                        <li>CascadeMeta</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>There are also some general fields that all Job Boards have access to. You may choose to ignore
                        these fields if they are not relevant to your Job Board. If you have specific requirements on
                        these, for example the title cannot be longer than 50 characters you can specify this. Take a
                        look at StringValidationMeta schema.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Produce POST /advertisements/byApp</h2>

                    <h3>Detail</h3>
                    <p>Once the recruiter has completed the new advertisement through the Job Board Hub and hits submit,
                        the Job Board Hub will POST to your app an AdvertisementWrite that will contain all the
                        information from the General fields and the information from the fields that your app required
                        to create a new Advertisement.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your app will need to process this information real time, whether the data is stored in your app
                        and processed shortly after or processed instantly as the Job Board Hub expects a response from
                        your app to indicate if the AdvertisementWrite is valid or there are some errors that the
                        recruiter needs to go back and fix.
                    </p>
                    <p>If the AdvertisementWrite has some issue with it when the new Advertisement request comes in, it
                        is important to make your error messages as friendly and readable as possible to non tech savvy
                        users. For instance, if the user has put an invalid URL into a field, you will need to return a
                        message that clearly indicates that the issue was and how they can resolve it, the returned
                        result for error messages is an array of errors and you can also indicate what field it is for.
                    </p>
                    <p>Example of a bad Error Message: "URL Field for Terms and Conditions is invalid"</p>
                    <p>Example of a good Error Message: "The URL you have entered into the Terms and Conditions needs to
                        follow the following format: www.talentappstore.com"
                    </p>

                    <h2>Produce GET /advertisements/byID/{advertisementId}/byApp</h2>
                    <h3>Detail</h3>
                    <p>When editing an advertisement in the Job Board Hub, the Job Board Hub will ask the Job Board Apps for the advertisement information each of the specific Job Boards. Your app will need to produce an AdvertisementRead that contains all the information from the last time the Advertisement was updated. From this AdvertisementRead the fields will be prepopulated with the information from the existing Advertisement and allows the recruiter to easily make minor tweaks if required or change information as required.</p>
                    <p>It is up to your app whether it is stored in the Job Board App or fetched on demand from your Job Board.</p>

                    <h2>Produce PATCH /advertisements/byID/{advertisementId}/byApp</h2>
                    <p>The Job Board Hub updates and expires advertisements on the Job Boards consuming this API.</p>

                    <h3>Detail</h3>
                    <p>At times, the recruiter may miss some information or the job listing has been updated and needs to be updated within the Job Boards. This will prompt the recruiter to go an update the listing through the Job Board Hub. The information, in most cases, will be the same with a few minor adjustments.</p>
                    <p>The patch that is sent through to your Job Board App will include an <strong>action</strong> field with the value <strong>update</strong>. This field indicates that the Advertisement needs to be updated and your app will need to apply any changes on demand similar to that of the new Advertisement request and return any errors to the recruiter in an easy to read and understand format.</p>
                    <p>If the <strong>action</strong> field has the value: <strong>expire</strong>, you can ignore all other fields on the AdvertisementWrite and expire / archive the advertisement from your Job Board.</p>

                    <h2>Produce POST/advertisements/status/byApp</h2>
                    <h3>Detail</h3>
                    <p>Different Job Boards have different time lengths an Advertisement can be advertised. The ATS may have the Job Listing open longer on their end. The other scenario is that the recruiter will go into the Job Board directly and expire the advertisement. This API allows the Job Board Hub to ask your Job Board App if the advertisement is still open.</p>
                    <p>The Job Board Hub will poll your app periodically and send through an array of advertisement Ids and expects a response that contains an array of objects with the following data:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
"advertisementId": "123-4324-23423"
"status": "expired"
"title": "Advert title"
"referenceCode": "1234"
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>Status can be either 'open' or 'expired'.</p>
                    <p>Polling will happen every 30 minutes At *:00 and *:30.</p>
                    <p>Once the advertisement has expired, ideally the advertisement listing information will still be available for a period of time to allow the recruiter to repost the advertisement if required through the Job Board Hub. In this instance, the Job Board Hub will calling the <strong>GET /advertisements/byID/{advertisementId}/byApp</strong> API to fetching the information for the advertisement</p>


                    <h2>Produce APIs</h2>
                    <p>Below is the APIs that need to be produced by the Job Board app along with example JSON for both the request and the response.</p>
                    <h3>GET /appStatus</h3>
                    <p>When apps are installed by a Tenant there are times where additional information is needed to get the app up and running properly for that tenant. If this is required by the Job Board App, the Job Board App will need to produce the following API <strong>/appStatus</strong>. Below is an example response when TAS calls this API.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>

                    <h3>GET /jobBoards/forApp</h3>
                    <p>The Job Board Hub will ask the Job Board App for the rules that need to be applied when building and presenting the new Advertisement screen. The API called is <strong>/jobBoards/forApp</strong>. Below is an example response.</p>
