Tenant API definitions and supporting documentation by Aotal, for Talent App Store.

Talent App Store is an open marketplace for HR microservices. Unlike most API-based marketplaces, TAS follows a peer to peer model where all apps are equal, rather than the more traditional hub and spoke model where apps are small clip-on appendages to a single master system. In a peer to peer system like TAS, any developer can define tenant APIs (i.e. app <-> app APIs), which any app can then produce or consume.

This repository contains Aotal's tenant API definitions.
