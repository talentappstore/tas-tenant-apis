<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The engagement APIs allow a tenant to use a third party (an engagement vendor) to perform some
kind of engagement action on a candidate or a job application, where that interaction results in data
that helps predict the candidate's suitability for employment.
</p>

<p>The API design is informed by the work of the HR-XML consortium, but is also suitable for very lightweight
engagements.
</p>
 
<p>An engagement might be anywhere along the scale from attract to hire, and might or might not involve
the candidate themselves, for example:
<ul>
<li>undertaking a skills assessment
<li>carrying out reference checks
<li>cultural/fit analysis
<li>carrying out medical checks or drug tests
<li>gamification interaction
<li>probity check
<li>HR-XML style assessment 
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Apps</h1>

<p>The diagram below shows the tenants and apps involved.
</p>

<p>The engagement vendor requires their own tenant.

<h2>Engagement app(s)</h2>

<p>The engagement  vendor delivers their engagement functionality as an app (an engagement app) that the
tenant can install.
</p>

<h2>Engagement hub app</h2>

<p>As well as the engagement apps they want, the tenant must also install a single "engagement hub"
app.
</p>

<p>The engagement hub provides centralized engagement
management and is separate from any single engagement app.
</p>

<p>It is tightly coupled (via shared database) to the engagement vendor app.
</p>

<p>The engagement hub app:
<ul>
<li>stores details of all engagement, including status, summary and detailed results
(including scores), links and actual attachments (documents)
<li>stores the tenant's installed engagement
apps - for example, the "Microsoft Office proficiency assessment app"
<li>stores a tenant-specific list of deployed engagement types within each engagement
app - for example "MS Word proficiency - entry level", "MS Excel proficiency - guru"
<li>allows the tenant to overwrite the title on each engagement type (for example, to rename
"MS Excel proficiency - guru" to "Excel expert"
<li>allows the tenant to specify a view against each engagement type - e.g. to make available the candidate's
completed "FSA disclosure" document when a "Finance team probity check" is performed. 
<li>can optionally copy down the set of default engagement types whenever a new tenant
installs the engagement app (useful for engagement apps that have fixed, generally
applicable purpose/volume engagement types; and/or
<li>provides APIs so the engagement vendor can manage engagement types directly
for any given tenant (useful when the tenant has a customised set of engagement types)
<li>stores the completed engagements
<li>securely mediates engagement app access to views of information about the
candidate/application, and prevents engagement apps from probing candidates they
are not authorized to access
<li>detects and securely tracks changes in view data (e.g. in the ATS, an additional
document is uploaded against the candidate while the engagement is in progress)
<li>prevents engagements being ordered when an existing report is available within the expiry time 
</ul>

<h2>engageui app</h2>

<p>The engageui app allows easy embedding of engagements within an ats.
</p>

<p>The ats asks engageui for an html fragment, and then renders that alongside other application details.
</p>

<p>The fragment contains buttons that can be used to order, view results and otherwise interact with engagements via ajax calls, without any
other integration with the ats.
</p>

<h2>Engagement vendor app</h2>

<p>A developer who is an engagement vendor must maintain a tenant of their own, and must
install the engagement vendor app. Covered more in detail below.
</p>

<h2>Engagement vendor UI app</h2>

<p>An engagement vendor will also usually install the engagementvendorui app which provides UI to:
<ul>
<li>View engagement apps 
<li>View tenants that have installed each app
<li>Manually manage engagement types for each install
<li>Manually complete a engagement (for engagement vendors with no technology of their own - others
will complete engagements in their own platform and use APIs to post the results to the engagement hub)
</ul>
</p>

<p>In theory an engagement vendor can accomplish all of the above through APIs so the engagement
vendor app is optional.
</p>


<h1>API design notes</h1>

<h2>Engagement types</h2>

<p>To avoid an unweildly proliferation of engagement apps, the engagement APIs support the concept of
an engagement type.
</p>
 
<p>The first step in the customer requesting an engagement is to select one of the engagement types that the engagement app offers.
</p>

<p>Some engagement apps may provide highly customised
engagement types, tailored to each individual customer's needs (e.g., "Acme finance graduate assessment"),
others just a single, generally applicable screen (e.g. "MS Word proficiency").
</p>

<p>The engagement app may update/complete the engagement through APIs, or an app is provided that lets zero-code vendors
update the engagement via screens.
</p>


<h2>Differences from HR-XML</h2>

<p>The design of the engagement APIs is informed by HR-XML but does not follow it slavishly.
</p>
 
<p>The HR-XML ScreeningResultTypeCode is not currently supported, as some of its possible values 
('Result'|'SummaryResult'|'Error'|'Message'|'Status'|'ManagementReport'|'MultipleResults') clash
with ScreeningStatusCode values (e.g. Error), or are not suited to microservices (e.g. MultipleResults).
</p>

<p>The ScreeningResultCode is not currently supported, as some of its possible values
('Pass'|'Fail'|'Review'|'RecordFound'|'NoRecordFound'|'Clear'|'UnableToContact'|
'UnableToFulfill'|'UnableToVerify'|'Positive'|'Negative') are ambiguous (HR-XML notes that
*this set of codes usually would need to be interpretated based on the type of screening and pre-existing understanding
between service provider and customer on criteria governing the application of the codes*), e.g. Pass vs Positive.
</p>

</div>

<h3>In detail</h3>


<p>ats knows to order a testly engagement for every candidate who successfully applies.
</p>

<p>ats checks testly still available for ordering by asking the engagement hub app for the list of available
engagement types, as served up by the sum of the installed engagement apps.

<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /deployedEngagementTypes

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/deployedEngagementTypes-simple.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>When engagements are ordered manually, the ats might filter this list, to only present certain engagement apps/ screen types
for certain jobs, according to some mappings held by the ATS, e.g. only call center candidates are asked to undertake this assessment.

<p>customer orders the engagement
<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /deployedEngagementTypes/{}/engagements

Request:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/engagementCreate-simple.json'></div>

Response:
... (blocks)
</div>
</p>

<p>The hub commits the new engagement to its database. This allows it to start producing APIs like GET /engagements/viaTicket/{}. 
</p>

<p>The hub pings the relevant engagement app to tell it about the order. Engagements are identified by ticket, not by id, to prevent
engament apps from probing engagements they should not see. 
<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /engagements/viaTicket/kuh7645gf8o7hngf635f7o8huyg/deltaPings

Request:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/deltaPing-simple.json'></div>

Response:
... (blocks)
</div>
</p>

<p>This is (partly) a candidate-completed assessment, so the engagement app somehow needs to smuggle a link to the
candidate and ask them to follow it.
</p>

<p>The engagement app starts by requesting more detail about the ordered engagement
(as identified by the ticket passed in the ping call).
</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /engagements/viaTicket/kuh7645gf8o7hngf635f7o8huyg

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/engagementRead-created.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>There's not all that much to see - candidate name, etc.
</p>

<p>We do see though that "inviteCandidate" is false - that means that
the engagement app should not send an email to the candidate, instead it should put the candidate invite link on the engagement report,
so that the ats can issue the invite (hopefully by immediately redirecting the candidate's browser).
<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /engagements/viaTicket/kuh7645gf8o7hngf635f7o8huyg/report

Request:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/engagementReportWrite-invite.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Since the hub is still blocking inside POST /deployedEngagementTypes (POST /engagements/{} works the same), it suppresses pings being
sent back to the ats, hence this does NOT cause a ping loop.
</p>

<p>Ping processing is now complete, return.

<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /engagements/viaTicket/kuh7645gf8o7hngf635f7o8huyg/deltaPings

Request:
...

Response:
200
</div>
</p>

<p>Now that all ping processing has completed, the call to POST /deployedEngagementTypes/{}/engagements
completes, passing control back to the ats.

<p>customer orders the engagement
<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /deployedEngagementTypes/{}/engagements

Request:
...

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/engagementRead-created.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>The ats now checks whether the engagement app set up an invite.
</p>

<p>It must first trade its id for a ticket, since all access to engagements is via ticket. 
<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /engagements/{}/ticket

Response:
890453924485634239058
</div>

<br />

<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /engagements/viaTicket/890453924485634239058/report

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/engagementReportRead-inviteOnly.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Looks like the engagement app did indeed set up an invite.
</p>

<p>The ats shows the link to the candidate (still at their browser, having just finished
applying for the job) and redirects their browser. The candidate starts completing the assessment.
</p>

<p>Eventually the candidate has completed their part, now the second part begins.
</p>

<p>Some person back at assessment base now needs to review the candidate's CV and their answers to the
financial probity questions. 
</p>

<p>This package of information about the candidate is called a view.
</p>

<p>A view is a json formatted package containing data embedded (e.g. name, address, answers to screening questions)
and linked (e.g.)resume/CV, cover letter, attached document(s).
</p>

<p>The customer can attach a different view to each deployed engagement type, exposing just
enough information for the engagement app to do its work.
</p>

<h1>ATS integration</h1>

<p>The ATS may decide to do any of the following:
<ul>
<li>automatic firing
<li>manual firing
<li>on response
   <ul>
   <li>waiting
   <li>moving to a new bucket
   </ul>
<li>showing results summary in a table cell   
<li>reusing existing results
<li>cancelling when declined
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Engagementvendorui screens</h1>

<p>Within their own tenant, the engagement vendor has installed the app "engagementvendorui".</p>

<p>They can use this to see how many engagements they are currently working on, and for which tenants.</p>
