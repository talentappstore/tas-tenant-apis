<h1>What each app does</h1>

<h2>The hub</h2>

<p>The hub handles as much as possible, so that job board apps are as thin as possible. Everything that is common to all or many job boards
is in the hub.
</p>


 
  
<h3>Handling installs</h3>

<p>When the hub is installed, it checks for existing installed job board apps and updates its installed boards table.
</p>

<h3>Showing the settings page</h3>

<p>The hub's settings page lets the admin user control the legacy source code field for each installed board.
</p>


<p>The field defaults to the value passed by the board via
<a href='http://devdocs.talentappstore.com/generated/recruitment.raml.html#jobBoards_forApp_get'>GET /jobBoards/forApp</a>.
</p>

<p>When set on a board, all linkouts for postings on that board will have a legacy "source=" parameter appended so that the ATS can access sourcing information.
</p> 

<p>Some ATS's will be able to use the information in the tracker for sourcing purposes and won't need this field set.



<h3>Showing the job panel</h3>

<p>The hub injects a panel for creating and updating postings into the job page in the ATS.
</p>

<p>This shows a list of the existing postings for the job, across all boards, including:
<ul>
<li>the board's icon (shrunk)
<li>the posting title (truncated)
<li>the status message (listing expired, job closed, etc.)
<li>menu/links to:  

<ul>
<li>Repost (re-open)
<li>Edit (shows the posting wizard again)
<li>Expire (close)
</ul>

</ul>

<p>The panel also allows creating new postings by clicking a board's icon. The user then is redirected
to the posting form in a full window.
</p>
 

<h3>Showing the posting form</h3> 

<p>The posting wizard is a web page served by the hub to capture the user data (job title, categories etc.) for a posting.
</p>

<p>In the top of the posting form, the hub captures common fields (title, reference, description and category values).
</p>

<p>The hub can also inject an iframe-ed page hosted by the job board app at the bottom that captures board-specific fields
(e.g. template, advertiser profile, cost center, video, headline, bullets, etc.)
</p>

<ol>
<li>To decide which common fields to display, the hub asks the board for it's settings
<li>To populate the category fields, the hub asks the job board for its categories
<li>To set defaults for the categories, the hub calls the category mapping API
<li>In the scheduled close date field, recruiter sees today + 30, though underneath the field is null
<li>The recruiter could also set scheduled close date to a value, e.g. so the posting is only open for 10 days. Or to a year in the future, in
which case the posting would remain active for a year, being re-billed every 30 days. 
<li>Once the user has ok-ed the form, the hub:
<ol>
<li>creates a posting object in its own database. The posting object holds all the data needed to post the job, including:
<ul>
<li>the common fields (title, description, etc.)
<li>the board-specific fields (held as a json document)
</ol> 
</ul>
<li>sends a "new posting" delta ping to the relevant job board app.
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>Handling expire, reopen requests</h3>

<p>The panel allows the user to click to expire or reopen postings.
</p>

<p>The hub responds by:
<ol>
<li>Updating the posting object (actual close date, close date, status, last updated by email and date)
<li>sending a delta ping to the relevant job board app.
<li>displaying ajax spinning widget in the panel throughout
</ol> 
 

<h3>Building linkout urls, including modern (tracker) and legacy source tracking</h3>

<p>For the posting, the hub builds the linkout url leading to the job on the careers site, including source tracking
information.
</p>

<p>The hub builds this by:
<ol>
<li>Call GET/BLAH to ask the primary career site for a link to the job
<li>Calling POST /trackers to create a campaign tracker and appending it to the linkout url
</ol>

<p>If the installed board has its legacy source code set, then the linkout url should have "&source= appended to it." 
 

<h3>Processing postings that have expired</h3>

<p>A dameon finds all postings that have arrived at their scheduled close date.
</p>

<p>The daemon:
<ol>
<li>sets status = closed
<li>sets actual close date = sysdate
<li>sends delta ping to relevant job board app
</ol>


<h3>Listening for jobs closing in the ATS</h3>

<p>The hub listens for jobs closing on the ATS. It closes the attached postings and notifies the relevant job board app.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>The hub learns via delta ping that a job has just closed in the ATS
<li>It iterates through all of the postings for that job doing this:
<ol>
<li>set status = closed
<li>set close date = sysdate
<li>set status message = "Job closed"
<li>send delta ping to relevant job board app
</ol>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Handling tenant reboots</h3>

<p>When the hub starts up after maintenance, or the tenant is rebooted, the hub pulls all
category values from all installed job boards.
</p>

<p>The job board's categories may have changed, making existing postings held in the
hub outdated.
</p>

<p>If any existing open postings are found that are using a category value that no longer exists,
their stale flag is set. This causes the posting to be displayed e.g. in red in the job panel.
</p>

<p>The posting form highlights to the user to which category needs fixing.
</p>

<p>When the user successfully submits the posting form, the stale flag is cleared. 


<h3>Handling uninstalls</h3>

<p>The hub prevents uninstall (returns 400 to DELETE /tenants/{}) if there are installed boards.
</p>

<p>When a job board app is uninstalled, the hub preserves all data by updating installed boards table:
- prior app shortcode = app shortcode
- app shortcode = null

<p>So the tenant can reinstall the app (or another customer who picks up the same tenant shortcode can install it for the first time) and the
old data won't be visible.
</p>
  
<p>However the old data can be shown (e.g. with strike through) in the hub's screens and in posting statistics etc.  
</p>


<h3>Maintaining audit history</h3>

<p>All changes to postings and installed boards, including who made them and when, are stored in audit tables or otherwise in some persistent store.
</p>

<p>Some UI in the hub provides a UI to see and search posting audit data.
</p>



<h3>More functionality</h3>

<p>More UI can be added to the hub that is useful across all job boards, e.g.:

<ul>
<li>List of recent postings across all jobs and boards
<li>Show postings per user/category
<li>graphs of posting activity
<li>Tools like FreshChat
</ul>



<h3>Hub database</h3>

</ul>
</ul>


<h4>Audit data</h4>

<p>Database tables/log files/s3 storage of who did what to which postings and when.
</p>



<h2>The board</h2>

<p>The board does everything that only the board can do.
</p>

<h3>Handling installs (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional. The board might be able to start working with no additional information.</p>

<p>Apply the need setup flag

ZZZZZ


<p>If the board requires any special information to start working (e.g API tokens, advertiser codes, and other job board specific details),
then as soon as possible after install, it should flag that the board needs setup by calling POST /SSSS. 
</p>

<p>i.e. On POST /tenants, the job board app should queue up a call to set a flag which.

The queued API call should be sent after POSTARTS event is received, i.e. tenant startup is complete

 later will call


the setup error message to "non-null" if the board requires any special
information to start working (e.g API tokens, advertiser codes, and other job board specific details).

NO - CAN'T MAKE TENANT APIS CALLS FROM WITHIN POST /tenants !!!!
</p> 


<h3>Produce GET /appStatus (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional. The board might be able to start working with no additional information.
</p>

<p>The board should call GET ZZZ to get its own setup error message (e.g credentials may have been denied).
</p>

<p>If not null, then the "setup required" icon should be lit up.
</p>



<h3>Produce setup page (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional. The board might be able to start working with no additional information.
</p>

<p>The board should call GET ZZZ to fetch its own state (e.g credentials may have been denied) and display that at the top of the setup page.
</p> 

<p>The board's settings page should capture any required information, e.g. API tokens, advertiser codes, etc.
</p>

<p>Once complete, the settings page should null out the setup error message field.
</p>




<h3>Publish board's settings</h3>

<p>This step is mandatory.</p>

<p>The board produces <a href='http://devdocs.talentappstore.com/generated/recruitment.raml.html#jobBoards_forApp_get'>GET /jobBoards/forApp</a>
so that the hub can fetch its settings.
</p>

<p>This includes:
<ul>
<li>job board name
<li>url (e.g. www.jobboard.com - used to create trackers)
<li>default ad duration (how long do ads remain up on the site, e.g. 30d)
<li>common fields list (list of the common fields that the board can use, e.g. ["recruiter email", "recruiter name"])
<li>default legacy source code (e.g. source=BIGJOBS) 
</ul>

<h3>Publish board's categories and their values</h3>

<p>This step is optional. A board may have no categories at all.</p>

<p>The board produces
<a href='http://devdocs.talentappstore.com/generated/recruitment.raml.html#jobBoards_forApp_categories_get'>GET /jobBoards/forApp/categories</a>
and
<a href='http://devdocs.talentappstore.com/generated/recruitment.raml.html#jobBoards_forApp_categories_byID__category__values_get'>GET /jobBoards/forApp/categories/byID/{category}/values</a>
 to publish its categories (e.g. its individual locations and job classifications). These APIs are called by the hub and the category mapper apps.
</p>


<h3>Synchronise posting objects into the board's back end in real time</h3>

<p>This step is mandatory.</p>

<p>As postings are created, updated, and opened and closed and deleted in real time in the hub, the board
is responsible for listening for these delta pings and then synchronizing the changes back to its own back end.
</p>

<p>How the board does this synchronizing is up to the board. Some boards use bulk upload APIs where the client always sends up all open postings. Others have web
services to modify individual postings. Some might use ftp, csv, etc. The board might do it instantly, or every  hour.
</p>

<p>There are 4 scenarios that will cause a job board app to receive a delta ping alerting of posting activity:  
<ul>

<li>a posting is created by the user via the the user clicking the hub's UI
<li>or edited (e.g. description is changed)   

<li>A posting has been closed (because of job closed or posting closed or posting expired):
<ol>
<li>close date has been set (is non null)
<li>status == closed
<li>status message == e.g. Expired  
</ol>

<li>A posting has been re-opened:
<ol>
<li>close date has been set to null
<li>status now == open 
</ol>
</ul>


<h3>Web page to capture board-specific fields (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional. A board may only use common data.</p>

<p>The job board hub provides the posting wizard to capture the fields that are common to most or all
job boards (job title, reference, description, categories, scheduled close date). So the board does not need any UI to capture these.
</p>

<p>However if the board has any special fields (such as an advertiser template, or a video) on its postings,
then the board can inject a web page into the wizard. The web page's javascript must pack the captured data into a json document.
</p>


<h3>Board-specific fields admin (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional. Some boards won't have any board-specific fields.</p>

<p>The job board app must provide all functionality for its own unique posting data fields. For example to implement templates, the board needs a database to store them,
UI to upload them, and then more UI inside the wizard page so that the user can select them when they create a posting.
</p>


<h3>Resynchronise postings after sleep (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional. A highly available board may rely on always capturing delta pings.</p>

<p>When the job board app starts up after maintenance, it should pull all of its own open postings from the hub,
and use that to call its own upload APIs to synchronise its back end.
</p>

<p>This will handle for any activity (new postings, expired postings) that may have happened on the hub while the app was asleep.
</p>


<h3>Synchronise preview links (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional. Some boards won't provide a preview link.</p>

<p>Some boards will be able to provide a preview link where the recruiter can see the job on the board itself.
</p>

<p>When a preview link is available, e.g. when the board's upload APIs are called, the board can update the hub with the link by calling POST KLHJLKJLKJJL.
</p>


<h3>Report stale credentials (optional)</h3>

<p>This step is optional.</p>

<p>The tenant's board specific details (keys, advertiser codes etc.) may become invalid.
</p>

<p>Then the job board app will start seeing errors when it makes API calls in to the board's back end.
</p>

<p>In response the board can call POST ZZZZZZ to update the installed board's setup error message (inside the hub).
</p>

<p>The board can then light up the "setup required" icon on the app, and on the setup page get the credentials.
</p>

<p>Once the credentials are OK the board can clear the setup error message, which will allow the hub to start using it again.
</p>

Reopen protection

Protection from two tenants with the same jobs (e.g. prod and copy of prod) pointing at the same job board instance.

Can cause duelling, where the posting goes up, then is taken down.  

The board should never re-open a posting (i.e. incurring a charge)
