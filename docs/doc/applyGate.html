<title>Apply gate</title>
</head>
<body>

<div id="toc"></div>


<h1>Apply gate apps - overview</h1>

<p>(For a Java/Spring example see https://github.com/talentappstore/applygatedemo).
</p>
  
<p>Customers can use <b>apply gate</b> apps to prevent candidates from applying for jobs until they've successfully completed some
pre-requisite. For example:

<ul>
<li>Ask all candidates to agree to a set of non-negotiables before applying, e.g. mandatory skills
<li>Only allow candidates to apply who are not from countries with draconian data security laws
<li>Have candidates complete a culture/fit analysis before applying
</ul>
</p>

<p>An apply gate app works by suppressing the apply button(s) on a job.
</p>

<p>Once the customer adds your button to a job,
the apply buttons suddenly are hidden from the candidate (this happens via switchgear, which is the app that marshals all of the
buttons that appear on jobs and elsewhere).
</p>

<p>To apply, the candidate must now click on your button, and then pass your gate - e.g. some kind
of quiz within your app.
</p>

<p>Your app then marks the candidate as having satisfied the gate and redirects them back to the job.
</p>

<p>The candidate can now see apply button(s), and can apply.
</p>

<p>Gates can actually be used for any type of button (print/apply/whatever), but to keep the documentation simple we only talk about apply gates.
</p>

<h1>Getting ready</h1>

<h2>Produce a button</h2>

<p>Your app will produce one button, which will cause some different buttons (i.e. any apply buttons) to be hidden.
</p>

<p>The first step then is to complete the steps described in
<a href="showButton.html">showButton.html</a> for your app.
</p>

<p>Once you've got your own button appearing to the candidate, return here.
</p>
  

<h1>Install required apps</h1>

<p>You should already have several apps installed from the steps in <a href="showButton.html">showButton.html</a>
</p>.  

<p>If your apply gate does not use SSO, you'll need to install the echo app.
</p>

<p>

<img src='https://cdn.talentappstore.com/apps/echo/echo.png' width="100px" height="100px" /></a> The Echo app allows your app to mark its own actions as satisfied without needing SSO.
</p>

<h1>Create your app</h1>


<h2>Modify your button to be an apply gate</h2>

<p>Adjust the response from the possibles API like this:

<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /actions/byCandidate/job/possibles/byApp (produce as non-SoT)

Response:
<div class='clientInclude' data-href='../examples/actionProductions-applyGate.json'></div>
</div>
</p>

<p>For an apply gate  like yours, the <b>semantics</b> section must be present, along with the <b>purpose</b> and the <b>gateBehaviour</b> sections.
</p>
<p>The purpose field determines what sort of buttons your apply gate will suppress, e.g. if you set your button's purpose to "apply",
then it will hide apply buttons.
</p>

<p>In this example, your button has <b>canReuse</b> == true, which means that if a candidate satisfies your app on one job (hence is allowed to apply),
and then later applies for another job, they won't need to re-perform your process. For example, if your button is for a company-side culture
fit analysis, then there's no need to make the candidate complete it over and over on every job they apply for.
</p>


<h2>Verify that the apply button is hidden</h2>

<p>After making these changes, open the qs8n app again. Your buton should now be showing, but the apply button that was previous showing should
be hidden - your app is doing its job.
</p>


<h2>Complete your app's experience</h2>

<p>Acting as the candidate, click on your button. You should be redirected to the link you passed back in the API call previously.
</p>

<p>You should now be at your app's web site, where you do your thing whatever that is (e.g. complete an online quiz).
</p>

<p>If your app uses SSO (maybe to save the candidate's data so they can start the quiz on a mobile
device and complete it on desktop), then your web page will likely be SSO-protected, and the candidate will be asked to log in.
</p>

<p>At some stage (e.g. after passing the quiz) your apply gate app decides that the candidate should now be allowed to apply (has satisfied the gate).
There are two ways that your app can signal that a candidate has satisfied your gate.
</p>

<h2>Call satisfy directly (SSO)</h2>
 
<p>If your app uses SSO, and the candidate is signed in, then you can call the satisfy API directly:

<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /actions/byCandidate/me/jobs/{job}/satisfy/{actionName}
</div>
</p>

<h2>Call satisfy indirectly (non-SSO)</h2>

<p>If your app does not use SSO, you can use the echo app. Your app requests a "satisfy link" from echo, and then redirects
the candidate there. Then the echo app signs the candidate in, and does the satisfy. 

<p>Install the <a href='https://www.talentappstore.com/account/installLink?token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiJ9.ZWNobw.KRnonFueIGABI-DWVu5Dr6xgsVfOxfL0dTr6bgT_FLx7Pmfz9fDDnwtG-70LFcYS5kgPQvmE3o8fU_ZSFWK0csyTEeMUV1_3plXLjndKOS13noRfDbtAt05V2BGE6Wsp5kqD1XMQWsqW5hKj14qcIvKpqv0igj9xL4w0ASk5_rCDhZ2jVs68ON-1plpqI-jtsrz6341hbCBmTsmtHaxvH_u0jwKb_hs6blTfKSisEHH_qbG05kzCcoC7zeX0xTsNr5NwJwnI8se_FuVF2EPp6sMau8jG-MDq2Wwfg8l7hB2IPdxe7cbFOoWXaim5a0SWrMP50NG8ljsNQT34ZJZ13Q'>echo</a>
app.
</p>

<p>Make sure you have at least one candidate identity app installed (so the candidate can log in).
</p>

<p>Update your app to consume the API (as SoT): 
<div class='codeBlock'>
GET /actions/byCandidate/anonymous/jobs/{job}/satisfyLink/{actionName}?relayPage=blah&tracker=blah?message=Good+news

Response:
https://acme.prequalify.com/jobs/10032?secret=87686kjhkg78587ykjh
</div>
</p>

<p>In this example:
<ul>
<li><b>relayPage</b> should be the same relayPage that was passed in to your button, since that's where we want to lead the candidate back to after
they've completed the satisfy operation.
<li><b>message</b> is a message telling the candidate they've completed your process, whatever that is. 
</ul>
</p>

<p>The page requires them to authenticate
using the normal candidate SSO (Facebook, LinkedIn, email, etc.), then immediately marks the candidate as satisfied and redirects them to the relay page.


<div class='codeBlock'>
+---------------
|
| Congratulations! You're a savvy dude.
| [Proceed to job]
| 
+-----------------
</div>
</p>

<h2>Verify the candidate can now apply</h2>

<p>Finally, you should be back at the job, and now the apply button should be visible. It works!
</p>


<h1>Choosing whether to use SSO</h1>

<p>One of the first decisions in building tyour app is whether you're going to use SSO. SSO is optional, and you can build an
apply gate app without it. But using SSO gives you some advantages:
<ul>
<li>Without SSO, canny candidates might fail your test, but then just try again straight away. You could prevent this using cookies, but they might
try again on a different device (or just clear their cookies). With SSO, you can store the candidate's results keyed with their identity, so you can
tell straight away if this is a new or returning candidate.
<li>In the future, APIs will likely allow you to attach results from your test to the candidate's record in another system (e.g. the ATS)
so that a recruiter/hiring manager can view them. Those APIs will require that you have the candidate's identity, which you can only get if your app uses SSO.
Without this, your app can't attach results (other than a simple "they've passed"). This may or may not be a problem depending on what your app is testing for
(e.g if you're just asking the candidate to confirm that they meet some laundry list of pre-requisites, its probably not a problem).  
</ul>

<h1>How gates are applied - logic</h1>

<p>Although you only need to worry about your own button, it can be useful to understand the bigger picture of how switchgear decides which buttons
the candidate should see.
</p>

<p>At the point the job page is displayed, the coordinating app (e.g. switchgear) will decide which buttons to display on it as follows:

<ol>
<li>switchgear already knows all the buttons that may possibly be displayed.
<li>switchgear now fetches the actual details for your button(s) and all other possible buttons for the job.
<li>Some of those buttons may return 404 indicating they aren't to be displayed.
<li>switchgear now has a full list (the "displayable list") of all buttons that wish to be displayed.
<li>Now switchgear selectively removes buttons as follows
<li>switchgear filters out any displayable buttons that:
<ul>
<li>have a purpose (like "apply"); and
<li>are not gate buttons; and
<li>where there exists at least one displayable gate button for that purpose which is not yet satisfied (e.g., your button).
</ul>
In other words, switchgear won't display any apply buttons if there is at least one apply gate that the candidate hasn't completed.
<li>Switchgear then filters out all but the first unsatisfied gate button for each purpose. So if there were 10 gates the candidate
had to get through before they could apply, they would only see each gate after completing the previous one.
</ol>
</p>

<h1>General actions</h1>

<p>As well as adding gates onn job actions, you can also gate general actions (such as registering).
</p>

<pre>
GET /actions/byCandidate/me/general/byName/{action}/byApp
GET /actions/byCandidate/anonymous/general/byName/{action}/byApp
</pre>

$(document).ready(function() {

	renderSequenceDiagrams();
	renderClientIncludes();
	renderTOC();
});
