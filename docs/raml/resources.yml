        API to get a link to a page hosted by the action's app that the user can use to to set up defaults or values
        for this action - for example, to set the referral amount or limits if the button is for an employee referral program.
        For actions relating to jobs, the setup page can be used to set defaults (at either the global or workflow level) or values
        (at the job level).
        
        Non-SoT, on-behalf (principal == user).

- candidateAppAction:
    get:
      securedBy: [oauth_2_0]
      description: |
        Get a single, named action from a single app. Non-SoT.
        
        The producing app might customise the button/control(s), or choose not display it at all e.g.;
        - for an apply button, display that a partial (draft) registration is already underway
        - gray the register button out if candidate logged in and already registered

        *Security considerations*: If the producing app attaches the incoming relayPage paramater to the button's link,
        then it should protect itelf from Open Redirection attacks as described at 
        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Client_Side_URL_Redirect_(OTG-CLIENT-004).
        
        One approach would be by:
        - attaching an additional digital signature to the link based on the link's other values, including the relayPage
        - verifying when the candidate follows the link that the relayPage has not been tampered with
        
        Another approach would be not putting the relayPage in the link at all, but instead storing it and
        putting a key into the link.
        
        The commonly used approach of whitelisting is not useful as there is no common repository of all of the valid
        domains in use by all apps that a tenant may have installed and that may include this action.

            The app has chosen not to render any button, even though it possibly could have, i.e. the app knows the action can't be performed,
            probably because of the object's state.
