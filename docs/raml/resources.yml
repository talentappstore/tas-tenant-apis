          Used to bulk upload or update all values for a single category for the tenant in one long-running operation.
          
          This API is intended for use both for a UI in the producer app to maintain its own database (by consuming its own API), or alternatively for
          some other app acting as the master to regularly push its data down into the producer.    
          
          The data from each category in the request is applied using JSON Merge Patch semantics (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

          The APIs expect external ID to be immutable.
          
          The app producing the API should do something like this:
          - start with an empty "mapping table" that stores mappings from incoming nodes in the request to existing nodes in the producer's database
          - if the request node has neither id nor external id then it cannot be mapped
          - if the request node has id, then map to the existing node with the same id (404 if not found)
            - if the request node also has external id
              - if the mapped node in the database has null external id, its external id will be updated
              - if the mapped node in the database has a different external id, throw a 400 error
            - else (the request node does not have external id)
              - if the mapped node in the database has external id, throw a 400 error
          - if the request node has only external id, then map to the existing node with same external id (404 if not found)
          - in all cases, a node can only be mapped once, otherwise 400 error
          - now that mapping is complete, producer can do the CRUD work
          - any unmapped nodes in the request will be created/re-activated
          - any mapped nodes in the database will be updated if required (e.g. to have a new parent, code, label, active status)
          - any unmapped nodes in the database will be deleted or inactivated
  
          The producer's behaviour need not be atomic - the call might fail after only partially processing the values, leaving partial changes applied.
          In this case the upload could be re-run once the problem was resolved.

        This API is used to fetch or query details of 1 to 100 job applications in a single call. 

        You should call this API either:
        - passing the "applications" parameter, to fetch a specific, known set of applications; OR
        - passing some combination of "bucket", "job", "candidate", "since" and "minID" to query an unknown number of applications, filtered to your requirements

        In the second case, the total number of results may exceed the maximum (100) per API call,
        so you will need to paginate the results as follows (results are ordered by since asc, application ID asc):
        - first, call the API passing only your filters (i.e., not the since or minID parameters)
        - if you get back exactly 100 applications, call the API again, but this time setting since and minID paramaters to the values from the last
        application in the previous response
        - repeat the above until less than 100 results are returned (indicating you've fetched the final application)     

        SinceDate is the datelastUpdated for the application.

        This API is called to ask an app whether it wants to be displayed in the universal menu for the given context (e.g. for a specific job)
        
        The producing app should decide whether it has anything meaningful to display for this specific context, and if so
        it should return a link, which will be inected into the universal menu. For example, if the context is job 100, then an ATS app likely
        would inject the URL of its job details page for that job.
        
        Apps should not inject themselves in a spammy way (i.e. when they have nothing relevant to this context). The user
        can always get to the app via the storefront, and will find the spammy behaviour annoying, so there is no need to do this.

        For actions relating to jobs, the setup page can be used to set defaults (at either the global or workflow level) or values
        (at the job level).

        When this page has done its thing, it should signal the containing window via a postMessage call, passing one of the verbs "ok" or "cancel".

        Get a single, named action from a single app. Non-SoT.
        
        The producing app might customise the button/control(s), or choose not display it at all e.g.;
        - for an apply button, display that a partial (draft) registration is already underway
        - gray the register button out if candidate logged in and already registered

        *Security considerations*: If the producing app attaches the incoming relayPage paramater to the button's link,
        then it should protect itelf from Open Redirection attacks as described at 
        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Client_Side_URL_Redirect_(OTG-CLIENT-004).
        
        One approach would be by:
        - attaching an additional digital signature to the link based on the link's other values, including the relayPage
        - verifying when the candidate follows the link that the relayPage has not been tampered with
        
        Another approach would be not putting the relayPage in the link at all, but instead storing it and
        putting a key into the link.
        
        The commonly used approach of whitelisting is not useful as there is no common repository of all of the valid
        domains in use by all apps that a tenant may have installed and that may include this action.

        The default type of the action is 'button'. If the type 'image' is used then the 'imageUri' property is used to specify the location of the image.

            The app has chosen not to render the button. Maybe the object's state prevents the action. Maybe the action is an apply gate and
            the candidate achieved a pass - 404 is considered the same as a pass.

        Your app should produce this API to return an array with an element for every different button that your app might ever provide (i.e., the superset of all of
        your app's possible buttons).
        
        Typically this will be called by a coordinating app at significant times, such as after the tenant is rebooted, or after your app has
        signalled a change to its buttons by calling the deltaPings API. That coordinating app can then present all possible buttons to some administrator,
        who can then flip some config switches to dictate which buttons should be shown in different situations.
        
        For example, the customer might want to only show a "refer a friend" button for their sales jobs, not their call center jobs.

        This API is for all possible buttons - at runtime, a different API will be called on your app to ask for actual details (color, label, disabled, etc.)
        of each **actual** button. For example, your app might declare with this API that it produces a "share" button, but then at runtime it might decide
        not to show the "share" button if it sees that the logged in candidate has exceeded some quota for sharing.
